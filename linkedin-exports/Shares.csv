""""
""1) Liquid staking is effectively borrowing an economic engine. ""
""""
""Instead of trying to make your token work, you have users bring a productive asset (liquid token earning yield like Lido stETH) and your protocol can leverage this productivity.""
""""
""2) This allows an interesting concept of ""re-staking"". Users can effectively ""leverage"" their risk-tolerance by putting their assets at increasing risk of ""slashing"". If you're trustworthy enough to make an ETH block you're likely trustworthy enough to tell me the actual score of last night's basketball game (and put it on chain). And you have the capital (ETH staked) to back up that trust or be punished for lying.""
""""
""3) The competition for liquid staking is going to be insane. ""
""""
""Whether organizations choose to boost an existing player (i.e., join Lido or deposit into Coinbase cbETH) or go on their own we'll likely see the market play a level above the liquid staked token itself. ""
""""
""With the way MEV markets have democratized profiting from block building, we should expect most tokens to earn relatively similar interest rates (as they randomly get a turn to make blocks). So it will be the use cases (again, see Eigenlayer) that will drive market share.""
""""
""Will VISA use Eigenlayer to bootstrap an Optimism L2 validator network, and allow their merchants to take low interest rate loans against their yield-bearing ETH? ""
""""
""Will staking with JP Morgan earn users discounts on their mortgage?""
""""
""4) The complexity surrounding these productive assets will match real world financial systems too. ""
""""
""Frax Finance for example has developed a somewhat hard to explain 3-token system. Users deposit ETH to get frax ETH. But that is not actually earning yield. Instead they must stake that 2nd token to get frax staked ETH. This deferred interest (1 frax ETH = 1 ETH, not earning anything) effectively subsidizes parts of their ecosystem. ""
""""
""This separation of ecosystem allows them to intermediate liquidity as if they were a central bank. For example, Frax mints frax-ETH tokens out of thin air to strategically improve liquidity, while trusting themselves (well, their code) to also keep an IOU of those tokens to be paid off. ""
""""
""Similar to how the Federal Reserve inflates and deflates its balance sheet without actually harming the functional supply of money.""
""""
""Liquid staking is a big deal. Some might think it's no different than if cash in your checking account earned the US 3-mo treasury yield- and that argument makes sense.

""------""
""""
""State difference is kind of like checking an event is true. You can write a contract that (1) lies about who sent what (this probably would not be a very popular contract though...), or (2) doesn't emit an event when it would be useful to.""

""""
""https://lnkd.in/eX6bGWQR""
""""
""1/ The Lido problem ""
""""
""LidoFinance is a network of network of operators not a single entity. I have friends with Lido as customers. They use a variety of clients and operators. Nonethless - 33% of network is a big deal. Especially regarding censorship & regulatory risks. Coinbase is directly calling out their competition. ""
""""
""2/ NOT pegged nor rebasing""
""""
"" Unlike stETH which rebases - cbETH will just be worth more ETH over time.""
""""
""Part of this choice is to make it much easier to be ERC20 compliant and easier for DeFi integration (which rebasing tokens can have difficulty with).""
""""
""3/ Different than Alluvial lsETH""
""""
""Alluvial lsETH - which I should admit I never heard of until now is a separate and more decentralized 3rd party version of liquid staked ETH.""
""""
""This has important differences, e.g., censorship resistance (of which you'll see cbETH is *explicitly* censorable).""
""""
""4/ Compound vs AAVE style token""
""""
""AAVE tokens rebase, making them easier to think about (1 aETH = 1 ETH) but harder to use (there are very few aETH liquidity pools).""
""""
""Compound tokens grow in value making them harder to think about (1 cETH > 1 ETH) but easier to use (you can put them directly into liquidity pools).""
""""
""Given the heavy competition from Lido and Rocket Pool this prioritization of integration w/ DeFi makes sense.""
""""
""5/ wrapping/unwrapping""
""""
""You wrap Coinbase staked ETH for cbETH. You unwrap cbETH for Coinbase staked ETH. There is *NO* withdrawal (yet) for staked ETH back into usable ETH.""
""""
""BUT- There is an arbitrage opportunity here. But is subtle - lower priced cbETH can be redeemed for more staked (but not accessible) ETH than market price implies.""
""""
""Note there is a 25% fee on rewards for cbETH. So stETH will rebase faster than cbETH grows in value - all else equal (i.e., no difference in slashing or other loss).""
""""
""6/ Exchange rate & Oracles""
""""
""Coinbase decides how much cbETH exists based on the underlying backing. It will add in exchangeRate and an oracle role so that this value is available on-chain at least once a day.""
""""
""Not the best frequency for subtle arbitrage- but glad something is on-chain!""
""""
""7/ Centralized""
""""
""Coinbase reserves all power to pause, blacklist transfers, and admin this token.""
""""
""Not a lawyer - but surprised this got through legal. Looks like a security built on them doing the hard work of ETH staking for the 'investor' (staker).""
""""
""Note something interesting....""
""""
""8/ Risk""
""""
""Beyond the standard risks (e.g., slashing, custody) they mention the price risk *a lot*. ""
""""
""True arbitrage won't be instant nor available until the Shanghai upgrade. But, as detailed in (5/) subtle arbitrage is available for those who trust 1 staked ETH = 1 ETH (+ can forecast cbETH supply).""

""""

""2. This database can include metadata""
""""
""Metadata is very powerful. Did you know the CIA was able to overthrow the government of Chile using telephone metadata?""
""""
""They couldn't access the *content* of executive phone conversations. But by hacking the [to][from][when][how long] of conversations they could piece together all kinds of exploitable details.""

""""
""---------------""
""""
""So ultimately, why would someone buy an article NFT? ""
""""
""They might want to publicly support content. They might want to signal interest in certain topics. They may want to show off the metadata (e.g., an image tied to the NFT) as a status symbol.

""""
""""
""1/ Design risks""
""""
""Token design must be resilient to large changes in price in *both* directions. Is there a *natural* mechanism that prevents death spirals?""
""""
""Assume that your worst case scenario happens and understand what hurts vs k*lls your project.""
""""
""UST lost the peg and, by design, LUNA hyperinflated (went from 3 billion supply, currently past 1.5 Trillion and still printing) to try and cover the gap. It will *never* catch up. This was bad design, not a hack.""
""""
""2/ Collateral risk""
""""
""If you use a lending/borrowing protocol (i.e. AAVE v2 clones), then you are at the mercy of price oracles to determine how much of your money can be borrowed with collateral.""
""""
""""
""If just ONE price oracle for *any* acceptable collateral breaks, then the entire bank can get drained by mispriced debt. This is called contagion and is very common in traditional finance (see: 2001, 2008, 2020, 2022).""
""""
""I give you 10,000 x $1 dollar bills, your oracle misreads them as 10,000 x $100 bills, suddenly I can borrow $1,000,000 dollars worth of your token and leave you with $990,000 worth of bad debt.""
""""
""3/ Liquidation risk""
""""
""Similar price oracle problem, if you deposit $100,000 of ETH, and borrow $10,000 USDC, but the price of ETH is volatile and the Oracle misprices it, you could get liquidated for all your ETH and only have the 10,000 you borrowed as payment, losing $90,000 worth of assets.""
""""
""4/ Governance risk""
""""
""When you have a project that is actively managed, you are subject not just to code errors (see 5/) but also governance errors.""
""""
""Blizz Finance on Avalanche got drained after the LUNA USD price oracle hit a 99.95% price collapse breaker. Because of their governance rules which require 24 hour cool down for any emergency decisions to be implemented, they could not pause the protocol in time.""
""""
""Also, of course, governance made a mistake adding a new volatile asset without understanding the contagion risk of bad debt. AAVE- the major lending/borrowing platform in DeFi has stringent processes for adding new collateral because they understand contagion risk.""
""""
""5/ Code risk""
""""
""If the code works as planned, then it's a design risk. But when the code does something unexpected that means the code was done poorly. A *lot* of projects (and 9 of the top 10 biggest DeFi hacks ever according to Rekt news) DO NOT GET AUDITS!""

""Having a professional smart contract security company check your code is the bare minimum.""

""""
""Now of course, NFTs do enable trust-inheritance on chain (you can trust an NFT as much as you trust the issuer and responsible party this is a very key innovation).

""""
""It's 10x faster to just have synthetics of REITs directly on chain as tokens with redemption allowed by a consortium of real world exchanges (e.g., NYSE). ""

""Real World land isn't scarce. Go look at a picture of ""the world at night"", the vast majority of land is worthless cause there's nobody near it. It's *people* that give land it's value (obviously natural resources too, but that's still people demanded). ""

""2) Overcollateralized lending (e.g., AAVE) ""
""""
""You put $200 of ETH in a box. Someone wants to borrow $100 worth of your ETH. To do that, they must put *$150* worth of something into another box. If they don't pay up, then you get their box (and profit).""
""""
""This sounds great too right, you know they're good for it! They just put in 150% collateral!""

""The risk is the collateral's value could fall very quickly, causing a liquidation. You lent out $100 of ETH but get back $101 of garbage token $GRBG. Now you're stuck with $GRBG when you didn't want it & it's price might continue to fall to $80 or even $50. ""
""""

""1. Ethereum is a highly adversarial programming environment. Code must be written defensively, while minimizing write operations to the blockchain (which costs gas that your users pay!).""
""""
""2. Defense is hard""
""""
""One major attack, known as re-entrancy, is when hackers trick your code into getting multiple effects for the same cost. ""
""""
""For example, depositing $100 check at the bank, getting a receipt, and going to 10 other bank branches in the city saying, ""look I have a pending deposit, I just want to take out $50 in cash really quick"". ""
""""
""Turning $100 into $500 by exploiting the time it takes to settle accounts. ""
""""
""3. Certain patterns form to protect against common attacks. ""
""""
""Here, the developers had a withdraw function in their contract of the form: ""
""payable(recipient).transfer(amount)""
""""
""This has inherent fail-safes to prevent reentrancy. But it makes assumptions: most specifically, it assumes the write cost is 2,300 gas units.""
""""
""4. Ethereum changes over time ""
""""
""The Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) has preset operations (opcodes) that manage the 010100101001 of computing environments. ""
""""
""These opcodes each have a gas cost (e.g., adding 2 numbers cost 3 gas). ""
""""
""Over time, the ecosystem evolves and it becomes clear that certain patterns of development could benefit from changes to these opcodes, including adding new ones and changing their costs.""
""""
""5. Assumptions are dangerous & there are always tradeoffs ""
""""
""The Berlin hardfork of Ethereum last year made some changes to how gas costs are done. A big one was cheapening the cost to do the same thing repeatedly, (e.g. deposit multiple checks at the same bank) by making it more expensive to do it the first time (e.g., the first check requires paperwork but the rest can reuse that paperwork). ""
""""
""The 2300 gas assumption from (3) is now broken depending on the recipient of the money. (Depositing money in a friend's account is easier than depositing it into to a corporation's). ""
""""
""6. There's almost always a fix""
""The money was trapped because 2300 gas units wasn't enough to withdraw the cash to a gnosis safe (the ""corporation"" in (5)).""
""""
""So what did we do? We found someone's solution on stack overflow & GitHub and tweaked it. ""
""We prepped the withdraw transaction with an access list that preloaded the gnosis safe address and thus prepaid the gas, so that we could get the 2nd call to be under 2300 gas. ""
""""
""Or in analogy form, we did the paperwork for a $0 check to the corporation, and piggybacked the real check off that paperwork.""

""Questions are requests for narratives. ""

""Let's break down why Ethereum is expensive, what the solution in roadmap is, and why alternative blockchains won't solve the trilemma first. ""
""""
""1) trilemma = security, scale, decentralization pick 2 ""
""""
""2) Ethereum is the most in demand digital property rights system on Earth. It is extremely decentralized and extremely secure, with hundreds of billions of dollars of assets relying on it. ""
""""
""But because of its prioritization of decentralization, it is not scaling well.""
""""
""Blocks happen every ~15 seconds, and the blockspace (blockchains sell blockspace) has a gas limit. ""
""""
""You can tweak the parameters to get more or bigger (or both) blocks but that erodes the decentralization (as now computers have to be better to participate as nodes/miners).""
""""
""Virtually all Ethereum competitors use this approach. Big blocks, faster, better computers, fewer validators, more centralized. Yes, there are some interesting architecture choices too (Avalanche 3-chain system) but generally they're fiddling with the trilemma. ""
""""
""3) the solution in roadmap is Roll-ups & Sharding.""
""""
""Roll-ups are like copy/paste blockchains except they inherit the security of Ethereum by posting their data to Ethereum as compressed call data.""
""""
""This means that people share the cost of Ethereum blockspace by doing their transactions on the roll-up chain and compressing it (using very advanced cryptography stuff, e.g., zk-SNARKs) before posting it on the world's most valuable digital property rights system. ""
""""
""This means: more users = LESS COST per user (the inverse of Ethereum bidding wars for blockspace). ""
""""
""Massive scaling. One example is Arbitrum.""
""""
""""
""There's some headaches here in terms of chain validation and speed of withdrawal and some other stuff but eventually, when Coinbase and other cash to Crypto onramps integrate these roll-ups (often called ""Layer 2"" / L2s) people will experience cost relief while still using Ethereum.""
""""
""Data sharding is updating the Ethereum architecture to be 4 (then eventually 64) different Ethereum blockchains that all coordinate via the Beacon Chain (which is live and functioning right now) after the Proof of Stake transition (""the merge"").""
""""
""This will be bonkers. We're talking about updating a $1,000,000,000,000+ ecosystem in production. But it will be critical for the century long vision of credibly neutral, global, decentralized, digital property rights.""

""2) There are 2 high level categories of things: utilities (things you use) and stores of value (things you buy with no intention of using). ""
""""
""Example: Alice buys an iPhone to make phone calls, use mobile apps, and flex that she has the newest model. Sade buys Apple stock because it's a highly liquid means of storing cash that she believes will grow in the future.""
""""
""3) Most things are actually in both categories. ""
""""
""Apple stock is a store of value, but it also has utility value- you have proportional sway over the business decisions made by Apple. Large stockholders can signal approval or disapproval with leadership.""
""""
""4) Most people only care about 1 of the 2 categories of a thing. ""
""""
""Alice might have thought of resale value she when bought her iPhone but probably isn't tracking the secondhand market actively. Let's call her a utility-focused. ""
""""
""Sade has never read a prospectus (same LOL) and is free-riding more professional stockholders actually providing feedback to Apple. She's just along for the ride. Let's call her store-of-value-focused. ""
""""
""5) The price of a thing is a combination of its utility value and store of value value (I'll use SoV-value to avoid making you read value twice). ""
""""
""6) When something is high in both utility and SoV value, utility-focused people tend to lose out from over-speculation by SoV-focused people.""
""""
""1,000,000s of regular people in US want the utility value of houses: shelter, warmth, place to put stuff & have friends over and make dinner, etc. (homeless people, renters, young people becoming independent, people who want 2nd homes, etc.)""
""""
""10,000s of multi-millionaires want the SoV-value of the US real estate market (good record-keeping, strong legal system, large market of future buyers, etc.) with NO INTENTION of actually living in the homes they buy.""
""""
""7) This conflict of SoV and utility leads to bubbles (see: 2008 mortgage backed securities financial crisis) that can cause real harm. ""
""""
""The solution?""
""""
""Separate the utility market from the SoV market whenever possible. Give speculators their playground for gambling- oops I mean iNvEsTiNg- and allow home prices to represent the *utility* value of a home. ""
""""
""#NFTs can solve this (under constraints and conditions, including broad social consensus). ""
""""
""It's not just homes that have this inflation due to SoV speculation- it affects energy (oil), food (corn, wheat), and other markets too. A lot of speculators with 0 intention (or even ability!) to hold, store, and transfer the underlying commodity.""

""- not making projects (file > new project) projects let you reference files relative to the project folder instead of relative to your computer. This allows you to send people projects and the code works because nothing cares about which computer it's on.  (i.e. users/Carlos/Documents/... vs users/Suzie/Documents/...)""
""""
""- using setwd - don't do it.  Just make a project and references your files using ""Data/"", ""Functions/"", or go up your directory with ""../abovecurrentdirectory"".""
""""
""- not using roxygen2 skeletons. When you're writing a script with a function, click inside that function {} and then go to the menu and click Code > Insert Roxygen2 Skeleton. ""
""""
""Boom, title, description, parameters, import, export, example, just like when you do ?FUNC to get help on a function.""
""""
""- ugly coding. Look up styles. Keep each line <80 chars. Break apart arguments. If a specific process is really ugly wrap it in a custom function and document that function elsewhere then source it in. ""
""""
""- forgetting version control. If you don't know git, use GitHub for Desktop so you can commit and revert mistakes. You wouldn't play a video game without saving relentlessly right? ""

""For this reason, I added two layers to the unemployment data used by the NPF. First, a private development layer comprised of two proxies for gentrification: bank locations (as a measure of capital access) and 2019 new building permits (as a measure of landscape change). Second, we would expect that resident displacement and the related stress would lead to desperation, so a social decay layer comprised of two proxies for the negative effects of gentrification – retail liquor stores and 2019 violent crimes (homicides and assaults w/ a deadly weapon) are used.""

""UBI is a sustainable means of ensuring a stable velocity of money. Economic growth stagnates in a low interest rate environment when loans aren't being made.
