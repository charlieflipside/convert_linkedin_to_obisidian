But saying Python is low usefulness I think is a bit of a misnomer. A lot of ""data science"" just boils down to automation, which Python is very strong at compared to R.

I would definitely concur on the competition- if you know Python join the giant line. For R, you need to work a little harder to find the line, but it'll be short. "

The difference is that some industries have their Elite boosted sooo much by automation that the Elite can take over the missing middle and lower prices. 

Television, Electronics, Software often see this happen! Moore's Law hasn't hit its limit yet.

But some industries are immune to increased quality: Clothing for example is at its lowest quality in millennia (Shein clothes for example are riddled with lead and radon). But the availability of clothes is unmatched. You can get used clothes for nearly free and much of the world does!"

-----------------------
Automation lowers the cost of lowest viable quality; often to near $0.

If you were barely passable as a translator, Google Translate has beaten you out of business.

If you were a middle quality translator; then Google Translate undercuts your easiest jobs; leaving you with only the low profit complicated work it can't do. This often beats you out of business too!

If you are elite, Google Translate does a lot of the grunt work, making you able to keep your Elite quality & prices (because your elite quality was always completely distinct in the market you play in).

This causes a ""Missing Middle"" in Price vs Quality markets. 

You can get low end quality at cheaper than ever. You can get elite quality often at the same or maybe lower price (b/c automation is a net positive for elite producers).

The average drops in both quality and price because low quality crowds out the market and causes the missing middle."

In the case of licensing people's images, there is definitely relevant use cases like scaling education, expanding how people communicate their ideas (e.g., writers having their work automatically converted into video and vice versa), accessibility (computer vision).

My worry is we're going down a path of AI: 
- reducing human creativity (example: crowding out Amazon book sales with a flood of ripoff content that isn't solved by the market pricing & word of mouth b/c it's a flood that actually breaks the market);  
- mass surveillance (better and better ubiquitous no-opt out face scans & public cameras that link to peoples social credit scores essentially). 
- frankly, de-education & disinformation (making people lonely, less informed, less trustful, short circuiting dopamine pathways so people have lower and lower attention spans, literacy, etc.)

 I don't necessarily subscribe to the idea that ""human content > AI content"", at the end of the day people can choose to do what they want and consume what they want. But AI's unique *scale* introduces a very specific risk where these ""marketplaces of ideas"" break entirely."

Yes, that is included in how I think of DE. But also, the foundations of what data is stored as what type, choosing databases, writing tests, writing APIs, building exception handling (one I see a LOT is dealing with large integers and strategically storing data as hex codes or compressing data), choosing schemas, coordinating on how to curate simplified views of complex raw data to make analysts lives easier, etc.

Our engineering team is I think 5x the size of our data science team. And give probably 50% of our DS team is client facing or tied to product development, one could argue its 10x the # of data scientists doing research/modeling. "

Feels like a real parallel to how crypto has coalesced around smart contracts. 

In blockchains, transactions are state changes. These state changes are verified, and when they include contract interactions those contracts emit events.

But this contract isn't enough, the events emitted may not correctly represent the event, which requires reviewing traces and the state difference itself (what changed in the dataset? who changed it? in what order?).

Will read up on this data contract idea to learn more. Congrats!

The ""They"" in this sentence is the Council of Economic Advisors & the writers of this report.

When I reviewed the artificial intelligence pieces of this report, I was legitimately shocked on the lack of commentary of what is going on with LLMs and how services like OpenAI, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc. could impact people's daily work.

Consider this quote from pg 45:

""The fall in the cost of computing power and the more recent rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence have led to a proliferation of computers in workspaces and robots in factories, which are helping workers specialize in tasks for which they have the greatest comparative advantage, like big picture strategizing, designing products, and interacting with consumers""

But we're seeing AI encroach on those very things: 
Strategy, Design, and being how consumers interact with products & support.

The most prominent items labeled as *problems* with AI were: 

1. Increase in surveillance & monitoring using computer vision in factory/warehouse settings.
2. Bias, like advertising to women is more expensive in digital ad markets, leading to fewer career based advertisements to them.

It's a noticeable gap imo!"

The proliferation of low-value content generated by AI could create a deluge of spam and dilute the quality of information available online. Moreover, as the use of AI becomes more widespread, there is a risk that it will displace human workers and contribute to job losses in certain industries.
In some cases, such as generating reports or summarizing data, AI-generated content can be useful. However, we need to ensure that the quality of AI-generated content is high and relevant to users' needs.
Furthermore, we must be vigilant in ensuring that the use of AI does not contribute to bias or discrimination against certain groups, whether intentionally or inadvertently. As AI becomes more integrated into various aspects of our lives, we need to develop ethical frameworks and guidelines to ensure that its use is fair, transparent, and accountable.
Overall, I agree that there are real opportunities for AI to improve economic opportunities and productivity. However, we must approach its use with caution and consider the potential negative consequences, particularly in terms of spam and job displacement.

I disagree with the blanket statement that all AI-generated content is ""worthless noise.""

Moreover, AI-generated content can be useful in some cases, such as generating reports or summarizing information that would otherwise require significant manual effort.
Furthermore, the assertion that all AI-generated content will lead to an exponential increase in spam is an oversimplification of the issue. The effectiveness of AI-generated content depends on the quality of the input data and the algorithms used, and there are already efforts underway to ensure that AI-generated content is of high quality and relevance.
Overall, I believe that while there may be some challenges associated with the increasing use of AI in certain areas, it is important to recognize the potential benefits it can bring in terms of increasing productivity and economic opportunity.

Instead of trusting events of smart contracts saying what is happening, I look at the traces and state differences to make my own judgements of how internal functions should be interpreted. Just because a contract says ""owner"" does not mean the same as what I interpret as ""owner"". 

I think of ""owner"" as the human interacting with the contract; but the contract may actually be referring to another higher-order contract that it treats as an owner internally. 

You see this everywhere in blockchain data; same keywords, same parameters, but different context. You can't take humans out of this loop. "

But when trying to parse these into usable SQL-readable tables like [trades] [transfers] [liquidity deposit] etc. suddenly the human interpretation matters a lot.

What is a contract, who is the owner of the liquidity, is that different than the event emitted 'provider' variable? The transformation step is very hard, very messy, and most of the time the developers creating contracts weren't thinking about how their emitted events will someday need to be analyzed and stored and transformed. 

So they put the bare minimum or use defaults like msg.sender which, in many instances where aggregation and routers are used, is more correctly described as the ""environment"" of a function call, not the actually caller of a function (which is the more dangerous to use tx.origin).

You can make a fresh wallet, and go to OpenSea and transfer your NFTs to that wallet. That new (cold) wallet won't have any approvals so the only thing you can do is transfer it back to yourself. The wallet *can't* be scammed b/c it doesn't have any approval() functions set.

There is still a risk here though; if you made a listing for 2 ETH 6 months ago with Wallet A. Transferred it to Wallet B (cold wallet). Then you transfer it back to Wallet A and forgot to cancel your listing; that listing is still valid and people can buy it from you.

NFTs are cool but they're also really tricky to manage correctly if nobody tells you these attacks exist.

1/ Connecting a wallet to a website is a read-access. They get your wallet address and send a balance request to your RPC.

2/ Scammers pull 1 of 2 scams: 

(A) an *approval* transaction (this cost $$ gas!) that may be hard to parse. Wallets are getting better about making sure you know ""Are you sure you want to approve this contract to access ALL your [Bored Ape Yacht Club][World of Women], etc.""

(B) The trickier one, a *private listing* transaction (this does NOT cost gas). This one is really messed up. It says, ""hey please sign in with your wallet"" but what is is actually doing is saying, ""hey, please sign this agreement to list your World of Women NFT on OpenSea for $0 to me in a private listing"". Because it cost $0 you don't see any reason why you can't just sign a login request.

So you sign it thinking you're logging into a website and what you actually did was give a cryptographic signature valid on the OpenSea Seaport contract to list your assets (**this only works if OpenSea Seaport has that contract approved, which many NFT traders give Seaport access to everything all the time, a bad habit) for $0 in a private sale."

To close the loop on some more info I found:

1/ this was not a formal clinical trial, it was a partnership with a company to pilot a proof of concept AI tool to scale up their staff. The staff used it only as they saw fit and not all did.

2/ unfortunately, the company in question has had negative press for bad business practices, including (allegedly) finding people in crisis online (e.g. Reddit r/S*ic*dewatch) and DMing those people to pitch them on-demand counseling services.

So, I'm leaning towards this company not being ethical.

There is a real worthwhile debate on the *scale* that AI has scraped images without care to ownership or copyright. But objectively, these models do NOT reproduce their training data when prompted.

They take inputs, parameterize them, and generate new images from the parameters they've developed from viewing 100,000s+ images.

We know this because the models are smaller than their training data. So it's not this boogeyman of choosing which stolen picture to match to a prompt. Which is really what people seem to think is happening. They don't see it as having *learned*.

It used to be either you held something you owned or someone else held it (custodied) it for you. Crypto has created this new middle of ""deployed"" assets where you still retain custody but it is on you to remove your assets from deployed status in case of an exploit. 

Disclosures isn't enough; in my opinion the code is either immutable or mutable. That is the determining factor for whether some fraction of custody regulation should apply (see my lengthy piece of schedules of regulation across the crypto stack).

If crypto is ever going to change finance, it has to be stress tested; contagion mitigated, and have some kind of known in advance scheme for how to legally attack it. "

You can code them for any edge cases you like. In this instance, the original Issuer might accept a petition to burn and re-issue the NFT to you since you lost it via a hack. 

The bigger concern is not actually the NFT being stolen. It's the NFT being stolen *and sold*.

If Bob buys the NFT from Alice; Charlie posts a (low ball) bid for the NFT just in case Bob gets desperate; then Bob's NFT is stolen by Hacker who then accepts Charlie's bid and moves the money to a new address for laundering...

The current law is that Bob keeps the house and Charlie loses the money.

The way around this is to code in escrow, have semi-permissioned transfers, insurance, etc.

I don't see a future of NFT = House Deed allowing for hacks to have a real world effect. I see a future where NFT = simplified transferable public record of a House Deed. There will need to be an entire legal apparatus around the NFT transfer, just as there is for the Deed.

The point is that it enables significantly better market dynamics than currently exists. The bar is very low! We're ultimately talking about digitizing archaic paperwork processes."

More recently: 

2015 | 2.35% Avg Interest Rate | $18.5T Total Debt
2017 | 2.28% | $20.4T 
2022 | 2.07% | $30T 

Your point on the average interest rate is correct; but we're issuing new treasuries at higher rates; and our debt is skyrocketing. Even if we assume avg rates stay < 2.5% over the next 10 years, if debt goes to $40T that's up to $1T / year in nominal.

I would generally agree if Avg interest rate < GDP then interest rates / GDP will stay in the 2-3% range; but I would need to double check tax revenue as a % of GDP before feeling too good about these numbers."

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYOIGDA188S

I don't have faith that rates will turn around at 5% given my interpretation of the jobs reports I've read. So far it seems they're trying to cull demand and reduce inflation by raising rates, but its disproportionately the destitute and marginally employed facing the consequences. 

Until upper and middle income people reduce their demand, we're going to keep seeing inflation stay >5%. Maybe these tech layoffs are a sign of inflation mitigation trickling up the income pyramid. "

The rate not changing doesn't mean it doesn't compound!

We're not borrowing $15T on 4-5% because it wouldn't work! The fed is trying to increase unemployment right now. Whereas in 2008-2014 80% of jobs created required at least some college, leaving millions underemployed that could have been building.

Interest on debt used to be $200B/year. $500B/year increase on interest payments is catastrophic but nobody wants to mention it.

Reason we haven't had sustained GDP growth >4% is cause we aren't building the infrastructure for growth! 1994-2000 had 5 / 6 years with >= 3.8% GDP growth. "

I'm not a VR/AR fan (yet) cause I think we should be focused on getting people into the real world more and connecting with other people in the real world more.

But having said that, the marginal costs of digital things is often trivial or near zero. That's rarely true for real things.

So digitalization of property and it's required scarcity can reduce marginal costs and increase access to good things.

If we see too much centralization, we can update the software to bias towards smaller validators in a variety of ways.

How I think of the broader question of decentralized computing:

1/ Data transfer cost vs computation costs 

I can have data, desired output from that data and explicit instructions of what computation leads to the output.

But if it's expensive to move that data, then the computation will happen close to the data, e.g., I have both AWS EC2 AND S3 instead of something like S3 + on-prem.

Assuming we see a future where data transfer becomes significantly less expensive, such that computation becomes the primary cost (and for many things we already see this, e.g., in machine learning) that opens us up to decentralized computation.

2/ Decentralization vs Fragmentation

Decentralization is inherently duplication which is inherently inefficient. All Ethereum nodes have all transactions. 

Decentralized computation does not benefit from inefficiency the way blockchains benefit from inefficiency (the inefficiency is the price for easy validation, censorship resistance, and credible neutrality). 

So how do we get to credibly neutral computation that is efficienct but not fragmented?

The way code works there's only two options: 
Transfer() of NFT requires centralized permission (to differentiate transfers to self from sales, requiring royalty to be paid on sales)

Transfer() of NFT does not require centralized permission, in which case marketplaces must choose to tax transfers *they* organize and send that money to the designated royalty address (which itself is not on chain, it's set at each marketplace).

For years OpenSea was *the* marketplace and they chose to respect royalties on top of their 2.5% tx fee.

As new marketplaces come in with lower fees and  disrespecting royalties, the speculators on NFTs will do the economic thing and not pay them.

This was always the price of building the NFT culture on top of speculation and churn as revenue instead of fundamentals like people willingly paying for utility.

Of course, do I think universities in the US are correctly priced? No way. Universities nowadays are 4 star resorts with bloated admin to teacher ratios and more emphasis on giving students a good time so they donate as alumni than actually teaching them.

Universities were heavily subsidized at the state level for decades. That ended and got pushed onto students and families. This is a massive inefficiency as now individuals have 0 negotiating power compared to the states.

My point is that federal subsidies are not the primary driver of cost increases at universities- because it's mostly a replacement for state subsidies that already existed.

Staff bloat, scope creep, technology administration, and, importantly, higher quality I blame more.

One might argue ending federal subsidies would force universities to cut back. But we all know they'd do it by reducing quality not reducing their own admin pay.

The problem with bringing capitalism to education is that the cycle lengths are too long. If I buy tableau and hate it I can quit to power bi quickly.

If I buy a year of 3rd grade and it sucks, the switching costs are immense: I might have to move, or rearrange my schedule to bring the kid to school, the kid will lose their peer group, have a jarring experience of being the new kid in a new school that may assume knowledge the kid didn't get at the bad school.

Bringing capitalism to education fundamentally requires commodification of education into discrete units.

I'm not actually against this- having ""addition"" credits vs ""multiplication"" credits where kids can re-do credits when needed or mix and match 3rd grade math and 5th grade reading is actually probably a really good idea. 

But bringing capitalism to education BEFORE you have commodified it into discrete units that can be interchanged and redone as needed does not work given the available data we have on state run voucher programs. "

One could imagine a bridge using a Uni v3 pool design with Liquidity concentrated between prices X and Y. 

If you split your TVL into 4 chunks, then as long as trade imbalance doesn't exceed some k*(1/4 TVL) you can provide people the same exact pricing as if all the TVL was in a single chunk.

For example, instead of x1*y1=k to determine exchange rate (where x1 = amount in the only available chunk) you can do 4(x1*y1) = k. 

Up to some trade imbalance the LPers get the same capital efficiency (even tho their LP is not active at all times it shares the separated fees with everyone)  the only cost is that slippage goes parabolic when trade imbalance is high (until a backup chunk goes live to reduce the slippage again).

You might need Oracle solutions or an internal TWAP Oracle or something to make it work. But we don't actually have to put all the TVL in a bridge into a single contract that's a design choice"

You can have arbitrarily deep liquidity at a moving price point- this is how curve works. 

At some amount of trade imbalance, you would for sure want to turn backup bridges online to relieve that balance. 

But bridges aren't required to use Uniswap x*y=k constant product for pricing their swaps. They also aren't required to limit their calculation to the balance of 1 contract. 

My point being, you can separate fees to another contract (uni v3 does this!), Smooth the reward function, and do swaps w/ any arbitrary function.

[Is it ethical] - TBD, but let's assume you haven't told ANY lies at all in the process. You answered all questions to the best of your ability as scoped.

[accept a job] - someone offered you this job presumably so immediately I'd cut responsibility by 50-80% on the accepter's end.

[currently qualified] - hard to define. But presumably the job offeror is responsible for assessing the qualification.

[to perform] - the action is important. Underqualified for heart surgery kills people. Underqualified to make coffee just slows down customer fulfillment.

I think it's worth asking what would it take to hard fork Ethereum again.

I personally think a Lido staked ETH bug during the proof of stake transition would be massive enough (BILLIONS of dollars of DeFi activity & collateral at risk) to lead to a hard fork.

And I think that's something people need to be thinking about when they interact with any financial/property technology.

Store of value has a context. It's about what can be bought. Euros can buy European goods. Their performance against the dollar doesn't change their store of value status.

The problem with Bitcoin is it doesn't have any context. There's no real economic activity happening on Bitcoin. It isn't the native currency of any microeconomy (except I guess bad stuff on Silk Road).

Ethereum has DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized use cases that give it a micro-economy & context. NFTs are priced *in ETH* and don't change their prices based on ETH/USD ratios. 

Store of value is about consistency in its relevant economy. 

Bitcoin fails because it doesn't have a relevant economy. It's digital gold. 

As more economic activity happens on blockchains, whatever medium of exchange is chosen by the people doing the activity will naturally become a store of value (the micro-economy prices in the medium of exchange). 

USD prices are not the reason bitcoin is not a store of value. It's lack of real use cases and economic activity."

Runs on US Treasury bonds, prescious metals, and AAA corporate bonds can all happen to uninsured money market funds which have expectations of liquidity when in reality, they aren't robust to large events like 2008 & 2020.

Promising 100% liquidity when you're actually only liquid 90-95% of the time is dangerous, but common and legal. Otherwise nothing could really generate yield.

At the end of the day, debt is how economies grow and illiquidity is important for businesses who expect that their loans won't randomly be demanded to pay up (no one could plan a business if their debt was callable at any point in time, because in practical terms, it is when you most need cash that your debt would be called)."

And the reality is that the DeFi protocols they use for yield are not always (1) liquid (2) guaranteed to protect units.

If one of these groups accepted USDC from someone and placed it in the Curve USDC-frax-usdt-ust pool; then imbalances in that pool could result in having less USDC than originally deposited.

This is called impermanent loss (made permanent upon exiting the pool).

So we can't actually be sure any of these groups has 100% of deposits available & liquid at any time. 

Illiquidity is often and explicit and incentivized goal of DeFi protocols as well (e.g. stETH, veCRV, etc.). 

So even if funds ARE 100% there, they are rarely 100% LIQUID. This is what makes bank runs so dangerous, you can do everything legit, but changes in time preference can cause spirals that are fundamentally illogical.

This is made worse when users don't actually know/understand where their yield comes from and are given unsustainable interest rates and/or unsustainable access to liquidity."

Other cheaper chains might be secure, coincidentally, that the miners/validators choose to be nice. But those chains are typically not plentiful in their miners & validators.

Ethereum is highly secure, honest miners make >20x as much.

So ""weaker chain"" would need to be defined more clearly.

If you define weak as ""changing"" then sure, maybe ETH is weak because it changes over time via hard-forks. But its much more complicated than just saying ""BTC is best"" because it is the largest market cap.

This would protect those holders long-term by making it impossible for them to sign a transaction that approves transfer of their BAYC because its held in a contract. 

Pretty much no NFTs I've seen have these kinds of staking tools to protect their community's $10,000-100,000+ assets. But it wouldn't really be that hard to build and if it saves even 1-2 thefts a year, it'd be worth it.

Gold is valuable because it has industrial use cases (small part of value), is highly durable (big part of value), and has demand historically (biggest part of value). 

It's liquid and ownership is trustless and its physical so it doesn't need anything like a miner network & the internet to keep it functional.

Having said that, Bitcoin lovers are often very focused on Bitcoin as a Doomsday store of value. This is of course ridiculous, in an actual doomsday scenario without reliable internet access you can't use the Bitcoin you've stored.

In a Doomsday scenario you *can* use physical gold you've stored. So gold would be significantly more useful than Bitcoin. But- the average retail gold buyer is only buying email gold. They aren't taking physical custody of it.

Although they *can* and gold sellers/custodians must deliver gold when requested for legal reasons there is the same free rider problem of BTC.

Because they hold email gold, they are reliant on the same internet & network of custodians risks that Bitcoin has.

So in a Doomsday scenario: physical gold >>>>> Bitcoin > email-gold.

But few regular people are taking the physical gold, and thus, what is the point of email gold?"

- advertising (give people extra tokens for walking in dense shopping districts, use a pokemon go model to get businesses to split visitor revenue and subsidize tokens) 

Do I think this will work? No, I don't, honestly. Globally walking infrastructure is pretty weak, and people's consumption is relatively rivalrous (people can't spend what they don't have so a dollar has to come from somewhere else).

Add in deflation as fixed supply of BTC erodes as wallets get lost; you get a deflationary asset with minimal velocity.

Eventually that dries up liquidity.

Once liquidity is dry, both sides (supply and demand) shrink. So Bitcoin could stagnate as circulation falls and lose its security.

The LUNAUSD oracle clearly states in the documentation and code that the minimum price for consistent service was $0.10.

This was >99.9% below LUNA's all time high.

Chainlink oracles must be free to exit service, the circuit breaker was set for 99.9% below LUNA's all time high. It crashed 99.9999% and these protocols FOOLISHLY allowed collateral into their products without having a plan for a flash crash of that collateral.

I got completely wiped on Blizz Finance (not for much I moved to AAVE months ago) because of their recent (5 weeks ago) decision to add LUNA as acceptable collateral; without proper due diligence.

This post has a fundamental misunderstanding of how Chainlink works. It's not a monolithic API company. It's a system for individual oracles to coordinate.

Merging Coinbase regular and Coinbase Pro makes sense, limit orders aren't that hard. 

Coinbase's real problems are not really the product line.

The problems are revenue relies on people making bad decisions (gambling on garbage tokens) which leads to a horrible UX as people don't even know what they're buying and they list complete garbage.

The NFT marketplace has been painfully underwhelming too.

To bring UST to $1 requires people to buy LUNA at lower, lower, and lower, and lower prices until the market caps of the two get closer together. 

Buying LUNA at $0.05 when UST is $0.40 is irrational for anyone except arbitrage bots; LUNA will fall below $0.01 unless UST demand recovers dramatically.

What options and shorting and leverage do is allow people to more accurately tell the market their opinion (including the range of prices where their opinion changes). This can improve market flow and estimation- but it can also cause derivative games like payment for order flows and open interest and dark pools and adversarial game theory.

So you actually have to give up X = [(5M * 5M)/4.9M] - 5M = 102,040 Tokens.

If you have a fixed amount of money that never changes, then how do new people within an ecosystem access money? 

They have to get it from people who are *incentivized to hold it*. 

Why would you spend a nugget of gold for a coffee, if tomorrow a nugget of gold gets you 2 coffees?

Deflation disincentives consumption. But it's consumption that makes money flow and enables more people and more activity per person. 


There's a reason the goal of the Fed (arguable on if they've succeeded) is LOW STABLE inflation. 

As opposed to 0% inflation or even deflation. 

Because inflation disincentives hoarding and spurs consumption which is how you get growth.

Does inflation cause growth? No. Activity causes growth. 

But inflation makes units available to denominate activity which is important for growth. "

So if the ever change the amount of MANA (which they probably will do if they hit critical mass) then the land... won't be fixed either! 

Metaverses that claim *we're valuable because we're scarce* are WRONG!

They are valuable because they attract users. It is a fundamental misunderstanding of economics and I stand by that. It is *people* that drive value to digital assets, not scarcity of those assets.

When the (few) Metaverses that lead the industry hit a hard cap, what will they do?

They'l launch more land! 

Sure, maybe the current Land ERC721 contract is fixed cap, but blockchain != Game. 

The games happen on servers that can be coded to interact with multiple contracts at once!

We don't have to speculate on this. When MMORPGs like RuneScape got popular they hit limits on how many people could play on a server at once- so they made more servers!

When Bored Ape Yacht Club realized 10K NFTs meant they are max had 10,000 people in their community, they came out with Mutant Apes and Kennel Club. When 37,000 NFTs wasn't enough, they came out with the fungible $APE token so that *anyone* could have a small piece of the culture.

When 80-90% of Metaverses launch collapse and we have filtered to the best ones, *they will horizontally scale too*. 

The fact that you're pushing lottery ticket approaches to crypto investing is also really bad. The vast majority of people should be allocating a realistic percentage to blue chips like Bitcoin and ETH, not gambling on SHIB."

Whether that NFT is *useful* in a Metaverse is up to the admins and devs of that specific Metaverse.

Legally, this makes Dai even more of an unregulated Money Market Fund (see: Federal Reserve Taming Wildcat Stablecoins paper); and it also makes the peg harder to ensure as the most liquid assets get liquidated first, the worse the peg is, the harder it gets to defend - which can cause a death spiral."

But how does that work in a blockchain world? How does it fit into who is not only allowed to hold a token (anyone on a public permissionless blockchain) but also who is allowed to sue? Will the courts find random token holders have standing?

If there is a single enterprise managing the renting and sending profits up to the token holders- are they registered as a security appropriately? 

If you avoid *all this* and just get a synthetic version of a fully regulated and very liquid REIT- how does redemption work when the synthetic is below the price of the REIT?

USDT for example is a popular stablecoin held by 10,000s of addresses. Their redemption has $$ minimums, fees, and is gated to certain kinds of institutions that are registered to redeem them. 

And that's for dollars.

We're talking about a few things in parallel, so let me focus on the Real World Assets point. 

In the real world, value flow is not irreversible. You can sue people who don't pay you and also sue people who overcharged you. 

So when I see ""Decentralized Real Estate Ownership"" I see a red flag. 

Many groups are doing this totally legit btw- they say, ""tokenizing real estate"" which means very specifically- hey we have a group of professionals, we're going to vet the properties, ensure renters pay on time, and share profits with token holders. 

They might even seek to follow good regulations around ensuring the token is equivalent to owning a piece of an REIT; they might even have total flexibility on who is allowed to hold the token (decentralizing 1 aspect of ownership- ownership of the token). 

But is it actually decentralized real estate? Or is the marketing purposefully hiding things? 

If the token holders don't get paid for 10 months. the price tanks. What is the plan for that? 

If the token price falls below the Native Asset Value, how is it brought back?"

Real world assets are durable and have practical utility. You can live in a real world house to keep warm.

I am pessimistic because the marketing is inappropriate and people will lose real money falling for the hype.

The idea of tokenizing rental properties sounds great, but it shouldn't be sold as trustless or decentralized. My problem is the lying, not the centralization.

The great part of web3 is the *competition*. Centralized groups who are trustworthy can compete directly with decentralized protocols that are trustless - and that competition happens on credibly neutral turf. I am not anti-centralization, I am pro competition (but based on truth).

Again, metaverse startups are not telling the truth- they are marketing 10,000 or 50,000 fixed plots of digital land, when we know that often it's just a few button clicks to expand that cap when its profitable to do so (and it will be profitable, which is why we see big NFT groups create derivative collections!).

Really the reason DAOs will fail is because:

1) they're DAOs in name only, not D not A, barely O.
2) they fail to back the seigniorage value of their token so price collapses decay the org.
3) they never build a development pipeline that is scalable while also easy to contribute to.

Voting is very far down the list in my opinion of why they will fail. It's more about failure to build than failure to vote. 

Another reason I say this is also b/c you can pay people to vote. So the parallels to democracy where you explicitly don't get paid and actually have *to pay* to vote (time cost, travel to polls, waiting in lines, getting harassed by opponents), seem unrelated to the core problem. "

Utility is the only game in town. And if you are selling NFTs to fund the development of utilities, see unregistered securities above ^.

Here, you get 100% of your yield upfront, the value of that yield in USD terms is of course market determined (just like any yield in a non stablecoin).

In my own analysis & opinion, in a mature ecosystem, frETH might be 0.02 - 0.04 ETH each, which is 2-4% APY (of course, could be lower if users are crazy patient lol). But this will depend on how it all plays out, the composition of users, their patience profiles, etc."

It is an important part of any economic strategy that requires more participants over time (i.e., the global capitalist system).

If population is growing 2% / year; then 2% inflation is fair. You have to have erosion of value from hoarders to make value available to new people.

Deflation doesn't work, it provides friction to *spending*, and in our current global economic system, it is *consumption* that drives 70% of the market activity. 

If we all stopped buying things, there wouldn't be jobs. No job = no money. No money = sell our stuff to buy food.  No stuff = hungry. 

Yes, inflation is stealing- but it's stealing with a purpose. 

Gasoline is what moves the engine of a car; consumption moves the engine of the economy. 

Yeah we could skip gasoline and bike everywhere, but it'd be slower and more difficult. We could skip consumption by making everything ourselves and hoarding deflationary assets for anything we do need to buy; but then the economy is smaller (see Global GDP from 1200 - 1800).

The incentive engineering is important and I am excluding that entire domain with my 3-item list. Governance, ownership, incentives are all critical. But ultimately, I would bucket that under Buy pressure. 

People buy because they want to join a community that is doing X. It's a form of utility.

I could see how this post would look reductive, ""Business is just revenue and costs"".  This excludes marketing, sales, product, etc. 

I'm not trying to discount those things. But it is still true that all the marketing in the world doesn't make up for no revenue.

Tokenized communities, whether they be NFTs, DAOs, protocols, etc. have to develop an engine that keeps buy pressure going.

A strong community, fun utility, good governance, a sense of ownership, etc. add a lot to buy pressure. But at the end of the day, there are operating expenses that must be covered: community managers, developers, artists, attention marketing / CAC, etc.

When these groups use high emissions and hype APYs and promises of development and early access to secondary NFTs they can dump on new people, that's artificial buy pressure.

So my post is meant to remind people the ""revenue and costs"" basics of sustainable business/community."

ID numbers don't have to be 1:1, it doesn't even need to be an ID, that wasn't the point of my post. My point about data context and how context determines the value of data not the data itself in isolation. 

Having said that, yes, it is possible that data leakage is a nightmare (see: Equifax leaking 147,000,000 social security numbers). But again, we shouldn't jump directly to worst case scenario.

Knowing (1 of) someone's Ethereum public address gives you a subset of their tx history. But it doesn't lead you to their birthday, social security number, address, etc. 

The current system of fragmenting PII w/o a native identification system on the internet creates that. 

I would rather 0 companies on the internet have my social security number, and instead log in with Ethereum to use their sites. They could keep my interactions of their site in their servers, w/o putting it on-chain.

In both instances your data is recorded and available to people you don't know and have to trust. But in the 3rd blockchain situation, you are widening the trust circle to everyone w/ internet access.

The benefits to this are better informed markets with lower barriers to entry (and hopefully that flows to better direct costs to you).

The cons are that your data is exposed to more people, including malicious actors.

I would argue we have the worst of both worlds right now. We have low info markets/high barriers to entry, rent-seeking surveillance middleman (adtech), and still risks of malicious actors getting our info (because we have to trust the middlemen in how they choose to sell our data).

I'd note that customer ID can itself be secure and/or limited, e.g., the ID being a store instead of a individual. Or an individual being able to shuffle/refresh their ID periodically.

It's easy to say, ""wow rich people shouldn't get more votes than poor people"", but that assumes a nation-state context where there is shared defense, air quality, environmental protection, labor protection, and other complex interactions of capital and labor. 

DAOs are opt-in groups. They're not countries. You can leave anytime. 

So coin voting for a DAO is equivalent to share voting in a corporation. Which is considered standard- those with the most skin in the game get the most say. 

The problem is that attempts to rebalance voting power e.g. quadratic voting or log transformed voting shares, just incentivizes a corrupt game of making your big pile of money *look like* many smaller piles of money so you can still keep your voting power. See: Sybil Attacks.

My honest opinion is that responsibility tokens don't work, revenue share is critical, and that democracy in DAOs is overrated. 

The most successful corporations are generally dictatorships. 

I think the most successful DAOs will be constrained benevolent dictatorships. Look at open source programming culture and how Benevolent Dictators For Life (BDFLs) wielding very large amounts of soft power have propelled programs like the Python language to the top of their respective worlds. "

You sell them in chunks at 0 price impact, 0 slippage, and keep your frETH. and After 30 days, you can just relock your leftovers, and repeat the process.

We're getting audited and thoroughly tested to ensure that isn't possible. In addition, there are smart contract insurance solutions if there is a problem. 

But really, the code is simple. Accept ETH, confirm you got it, mint NFT. Accept NFT, confirm you got it, destroy it, then give back ETH. 

This should be as close to (0 + 1) = (2 - 1) as we can get it code wise. 

The main counterparty risk in the OTC side of things depend on how its done. 

1) Marketplaces like OpenSea are thoroughly tested to ensure that IF offer is accepted, THEN, swap the ETH for the NFT, if anything breaks (e.g., the buyer moved the ETH to try and get the NFT for free) it all reverts. 

This is standard and trusted for $100Ms in daily volume. 

2) Direct OTC, where someone has to send the money first and the other party sends the asset 2nd, is the major risk. As now you are fully trusting the counterparty to deliver, without using a trustless intermediary/escrow/etc.

Huge arbitrage opportunity to profit from patience or maximize your trading profits through treating NFTs as discrete units of a stack of ETH. 
Instead of buying 10,000 ETH, you can buy 1000, 10 ETH freezers. You may even be able to get a discount on them depending on the maturity date!

Imagine paying 9,980 ETH for 10,000 ETH and the only price is you must be patient OR pay frETH & small (0.25%) ETH penalty to redeem the Freezer.

Generally, clients will be better about scope in hours based (but consultants will be worse and leech hours) 

While in project based, consultants will be better about scope, but clients will try and leech hours through scope creep. 

From my experience, scope creep is inevitable, so project based pricing has lots of risks. Although with clients I've had, it's often mixed. 

There's hourly rates, and then there's scope, and then there's fixed fee.

That way clients have a cap on overall expenses, and consultants have their hourly, but, to impress clients and grow business, they cram more things into the cap (i.e., finishing projects early and starting new ones). 

This makes it easier for clients to experience proof of concepts that they paid for in previous contracts, and they can choose to fund new projects based on those POCs. As opposed to making a contract to create a POC, which is never fun for anyone cause there's pressure to make the POC into an MVP which becomes a version 0.1 that is treated like a 1.0 and very messy.

It is not stable relative to the Ruble.

ETH is not stable to anything- it is the token required to pay for ethereum blockspace. BTC is the token required to pay for Bitcoin blockspace. 

Demands for that blockspace is also not stable. So there is no way to say there is stability through any ""intrinsic"" value. 

Dollars are the token required to pay US taxes and debts. It is not intrinsically stable either. It's forced to be stable by the Federal Reserve.

If the traditional financial system ""collapses"" - then we won't be talking about ETH and BTC. We'll be talking about trading 2 cans of Chef Boyardee for 3 expired Advils.

If you are talking specifically about the censorship risks of stablecoins - USDC and USDT both have address censorship as required by laws around AML and terr*rist financing. 

But others like UST, Dai, Rai, MIM, Mai, etc. don't have that risk. 

Some have other risks, like being backed by ETH in a contract, and a contract migration could mess up their backing. But that's a separate issue."

Some use an equity contract (i.e., money market fund but with less regulation, and I should note MMFs were bailed out in both 2008 and 2020,) some use a debt contract (e.g., USDC). 

Returns on stablecoins are a separate discussion. Anchor subsidizes unrealistic returns on UST (20%+). But sustainable yield of 2-4% is realistic. There are multiple $1B+ *over*collateralized markets in DeFi right now: Curve, Compound, AAVE, Maker, etc. with users opting into those rates.

My opinion is that the best of these stablecoins (the ones with the most liquid markets and desire to be held by institutions and whales, e.g. USDC, USDT, Dai) have proven to be good for their value across multiple highly volatile market cycles. 

Remember, the US Stock market has circuit breakers to stop trading. DeFi markets (nearly always) run 24/7 with no such supports to reduce volatility. 

If Dai and USDC can survive in these situations multiple times a year, I think the logical thing to do is start pushing traditional markets to run transparently, credibly neutrally, and without privileged access to after-hours markets."

A USDC is tradeable for $1 exactly, not $1 in value (like UST, Dai, USDT, etc. which are all equity contracts).

Who won and lost in the dollarization of the global economy from 1900-present? 

This chart is true, but it's not getting the point of inflation. 

The 2 reasons to inflate a currency are:
 
(1) Seigniorage: profit made by those who print the money above the cost to make it, I.e., if a $20 bill cost $1 to make, who gets that $19 in value difference? This is a dangerous game and governments have failed after exploiting this.

(2) demand for denominated assets. 

People want US dollars and things that can be made into US dollars quickly. What is cash? Cash is the most liquid and anonymous form of value transfer.

This has value. And the US has extracted a lot of value from this fact.

You wouldnt put up a chart and say ""value of 1 Google stock"" over time and see it plummet 95% and say it was poorly run!
 
Google strategically splits its stock (everyone keeps the same ratio they just scale up the amount) so that it'd be cheaper to hold a whole stock (although fractionalization is common today, it wasn't always so).

The US, having the world's most in demand cash, inflates its currency the same way. Inflation makes holding the base unit (a $1 bill or more specifically a penny), easier to do, because it takes less [insert product or service] to get a unit. 

The problem is not that the currency inflates (i.e., the stock splits), the problem is in how this split is not proportional, and it actually extracts value from current holders to support the acquisition of new holders. 

This is how networks grow- they add more people and those people's activities. 

The world 8x'd in population since 1900. The number of people the dollar is used by has >100x'd in that same time. 

The problem isn't the inflation, it's the lack of equity in who benefits from global dollarization.

1. Goal of DAO is Evangelize, Build, Analyze. Not education. It's to get people hyped enough to self-learn, give them resources & people to self-learn with, and a place to ask questions, get feedback on ideas, and find ideas to support. Education is an entire discipline that we're not equipped to take-on. 

Having said that, I think making an 8 hour free course covering *all* the fundamentals of web3 that I can think of (economics, finance, cryptography, social systems, internet history, 2008, data, bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts, NFTs/ERC20, DAOs, block explorers, adding a new network to your metamask, holy crap this list is getting long) - might be a good starting spot. 

Give everyone an NFT representing a minimum level of understanding for them to springboard somewhere else.

2. most important are (1) evangelism, we need content to build influence, and (2) build- become a real incubator for ideas ->MVPs > spin-out. (3) Analysis would be least important in that regard, as it would be mostly a subset of (1) and (2).

If you sell tokens to people with the understanding that they will profit from the DAOs work, that's a problem. 
Right now, there's a massive ""loophole"" in ""governance"" where people can buy/sell a product (a voting point) and people just coincidentally profit/loss. 

But unfortunately, as we're seeing in I think 99% of DAOs, those tokens peak as emissions get too high, and then the price tanks. I can't think of any DAO off the top of my head that isn't down >60% from ATH without a complete tokenomics re-work to incorporate real revenue flows into the token (which makes it objectively a security).

Really, you buy DAO tokens to support the mission, they might as well be a donation given how poorly designed emission rates & liquidity targeting are."

1) Ethereum smart contracts are immutable. The tornado contracts (there are multiple) exist in perpetuity until people stop staking in them, but they can't be deleted. Nothing the Patriot Act can do. 

2) Private transactions (i.e. cash-like transactions) are fundamental rights. As we are seeing in Canada (where I disagree with anti vax protesters) - the ability to close financial accounts and force people out of the financial system without due process leads to a *lot* of false positives. 

It sounds easy to say- ""nobody who gives donations or crypto to people who block major highways!!! Banks go stop them"". 

But then you get incorrect names... Or unrelated people with the same last name. Or 3rd cousins who don't talk to them but 3 years ago sent their aunt a money transfer to a shared account with a trucker. 

If we accept financial shutdowns of people without using the court system, we should expect BLM, pro rights, and progressives doing civil disobedience to get the same (probably worse...) treatment as soon as its politically expedient. 

3) The question is- do online transactions deserve to have a cash (anonymous peer to peer, the DEFAULT of money for 1000s of years) option? 

There's pros and cons on both sides. But the Patriot Act has literally gotten 100,000s of people killed all over the world. There's no way we should ever evoke it as a positive. 

4) Tornado has compliance tools to export your notes and tie together transactions for taxes. Of course, not everybody uses it. But it's entirely possible to tweak the laws in a reasonable way to require compliance reports for transactions above a certain size (note: this is actually how the current financial system works with $600 & $10,000 paperwork thresholds). "

it's important to note the boundaries of where OpenSea's code was faulty.

1) User generates a transaction signature that details a $0 private listing of an NFT
2) That user has OpenSea as approved for moving their NFT

3) Hacker can submit (1) to the OpenSea contract with [target address] as the exploiter contract they created.

OpenSea then (because of bad trust assumptions around how tx signatures can be generated) TRIGGERS the exploited contract's code once it moves the NFT to that contract.

This exploiter contract then takes *all* NFTs it can from the user with a single tx signature.

1) bank runs are not a thing. We've regulated out all risks of storing pure cash (that's why we have 0% interest, the risk was socialized by FDIC + US dollar hegemony)

2) that said, there is a real movement toward ending anonymous transactions (ending cash) and enforcing a centralized global financial system that allows for *negative* interest rates (which is worse than inflation in many ways)

3) crypto is great, I'm highly optimistic for stablecoins, especially decentralized ones. 

4) when people say ""crypto is uninsured"" they're misunderstanding the long tail risk. The risk for dollars is not that your balance will disappear (solved by FDIC & federal regulations). The risk is that the value of your balance will disappear (hyper inflation). 

The risk for crypto is the *exact same*. There's no risk your balance will disappear (solved by cryptography & decentralization). There's only the risk the value will disappear (loss of demand for your token).

5) having said that, any crypto/dollar pair will be highly volatile. That's the price of not having trillions of dollars available to algorithmic trading and centralized circuit breakers to stop markets. 

The benefit of the volatility is that it actually better reflects market opinion. The artificial stability of the stock and forex markets are like drinking when you're hungover. It might work at worst, but you'll pay eventually and it'll be worse and take longer to get better. "

It's terrible that 100,000s of people's first experience of NFTs is the widespread scam playbook. The price of decentralization and open source code is that it's trivial to spin-up scams. 

In just the last 10 years we've seen telephone calls go from fundamental freedom enhancing communication tool to unusable scam-fest where you can't safely answer unknown numbers anymore. 

Long-term, eventually, people will have semi-centralized playgrounds where trusted intermediaries give them guard rails for risk. VISA will have an EVM Roll-up.

Definitely makes sense to take the comfortable role with growth and not risk getting fired when you realize managing a 20 person team is insane. But you really would have risked losing a perfect candidate for £10k? 

Developers at large places generate $1M+ in revenue annually, at small places $200-300k+. 

I feel like the appropriate thing to do would have been to stretch to £60k and formalize the growth plan (early or more than annual review cycles, a budget for conferences, or similar) inside the offer. 

Heads of development don't have the time (and it's arguably not fair) to mentor a single dev over others. 

I'm not denying the good intentions, I'm sure they want to mentor this dev. But if they end up with less mentorship than they expect (b/c it wasn't written out) and they also feel the pain of £1000/month less in their pocket they are a prime candidate for high quality turnover.

An NFT is a distributed database assigning metadata to an owner (that metadata may include a picture, but doesn't have to). Typically, these are most effective when publicly available on a blockchain so that it can be composable. 

Let's say the NFL and Budweiser team up to give people 15% off Budweiser in stadiums. There's three ways to handle that currently: the NFL can integrate that into an app of theirs, or Budweiser can integrate it into an app of theirs, or there could be some broad [3rd way]. For example, a piece of paper or a card. 

The 3rd ways are great for being easily transferrable, but they can also be made fraudulent.

If instead the NFL & Budweiser both used Ethereum as a shared data layer, they could launch an NFT representing the discount and get the best of low cost for them, transferability for you, and fraud resistant. 

Loyalty programs, coupons, marketing, etc. are some of the low hanging fruit that can make use of NFTs. 

Just like you might have an app to your favorite food spots (Chic Fil A is a leader in app adoption for fast food), you'll have NFTs on a public ledger giving you *transferable* benefits for your activity. 

It isn't just art and money laundering. It's a really good way of tracking digital scarcity across users without over-sharing critical information. 

Does Chic Fil A really need your full name, email, date of birth, home address, and credit card? No, it's just that tracking transaction history to enable digital scarcity previously required such things. NFTs solve this "

Ethereum currently uses proof of work (like Bitcoin), but is transitioning to proof of stake this year, which will reduce energy consumption by >99%. 

That said, using energy is not how ""terrible for environment"" works. Many things use energy, we don't moralize them just because we don't personally do it. 

Training AI models in the cloud, streaming 4K, the military industrial complex, global supply chains, the current financial system, etc. all use incomprehensible amounts of energy. Are they bad for the environment? Maybe, but that's a moral argument that they aren't worth their energy expenditure. 

Many support each of these despite their energy costs. If you are already anti blockchain, then of course you're going to say it's not worth it's energy. 

The US military industrial complex is the world's largest (& widest) polluter. I don't think it's worth it's energy or financial expenditure- that's my personal opinion 🤷"

An Arbitrum token that has no fundamental use besides to drive speculation in the hopes that the speculation also drives usage/adoption is risky in my opinion.

When I played RuneScape (too much) they were constantly paranoid about bots & farms. So doing the same behavior repeatedly for hours on end (which you did legitimately need to do sometimes because the game is a grind fest 😂) would trigger random encounters with non-dangerous NPCs that requires you to interact with visual elements in the game (kind of like a captcha) to get out of. 

The shadow economy of real world asset trading got so bad, that they even once destroyed their economy to stop it. They made peer to peer trading a nightmare, capped the amount of ""market value"" that could be transferred in a trade (can't trade a $10 sword for a $3 shield, too big of a gap in value), and just generally wrecked their game. 

Eventually they gave in and did the inverse. Created an entire grand exchange to facilitate *anonymous* peer to peer trading. 

So there are a lot of decisions games need to make when they want to intrinsically support peer to peer exchange."

I have NFTs for a game called The Treeverse. The goal is to create an MMORPG with runescape inspired skills but a more modern combat system. It is live right now with minimal features (houses to show off your NFTs, a small world for your avatar to walk around in, and chat boxes). 

To me, I like that they've focused on developing in public and being communicative about features and goals, WITHOUT talking about prices. When people complain about prices, they generally silo that conversation to a single discord thread. 

When I look at Axie Infinity (of which I own a small amount within an index token I hold), I see too much talk about revenue and asset accrual and volume and rarity, etc. Feels like nobody is playing it *for fun*. Of course, I could be wrong, this is just an outsider biased perspective. 

There's also the headaches of tokens. Axie has a two-token model. Treeverse doesn't yet have a token besides their NFTs (but they're planning them).

- How many people are regularly playing this game?
- What % of them are doing it for asset accrual (pyramid percentage)?
- What % of them are doing it for true entertainment (consumption percentage)? 

Obviously there will be a mix of both. As soon as you financialize a game you're inviting a wave of speculators and the resulting bubbles. You have to identify the ""true fans"" who are in it regardless of real world prices of their assets. But at the same time, you want those true fans to have an easy on/off ramp so they can *come back* in the future. 

My honest opinion is, none of it is truly sustainable. Every game worth playing has dilution and power creep that will never be managed perfectly. The goal is to create more fun than you create financial loss for people left holding the bag. 

Relatedly, is minimizing the principal-agent problem. As a game gets financialized you have to increasingly worry about information asymmetry. 

We saw this with OpenSea when the Head of Product was buying NFTs before they appeared on the ""Featured Artists"" page, and then selling them after for profit.

Your game developers and product managers and insiders who are planning new features will have front-run incentives too."

Thorchain and Elk use their own proprietary token to back all their supported chains creating ""continuous liquidity pools"". When Thorchain got hacked from a tx.origin (never use this) bug, they just took the hit I think and the token price collapsed. 

This was a different type of bridge. Wormhole accepted WETH onto their Ethereum contract and then a signal was sent to the Solana contract to mint new wormETH (idk the real ticker symbol sorry). 

This wormETH was only valued as ETH on Solana because it had widespread trust and interoperability (you could bridge back and to my knowledge a few exchanges even accepted wormETH deposits as equivalent to ETH when given to their Solana addresses).

Jury is out on which model is better. There's always different ways of distributing the risk. 

For example, Hop Protocol has users stake assets on both sides of their supported chains and they earn swap fees. These users are the consenting risk-takers (as opposed to Hop Protocol). With wormhole, technically all the holders of wormETH are the risk-takers (most without an accurate estimate of the risk since Solana has an anti-open source dev culture that doesn't reveal their code)."

Utility tokens have a specific use case, e.g., you pay for a Chainlink query with $LINK. Holding $LINK doesn't give you direct value. 

Governance tokens have the use-case of voting on changes to a protocol.

Often, because of fear and uncertain regulatory environment in the US, web3 DAOs will avoid revenue tokens and try to use their governance token instead. The problem is, that governance is constantly diluted to give new people a chance to govern too, and the price falls, and then people leave the project because they don't get value. 

If revenue tokens had better regulation, we would see less complex governance tokens, and better projects and markets overall."

How do we make these useful for holders? A commodity has intrinsic use. I buy art to look at it. Businesses buy wheat to make bread. Refineries buy oil to make gasoline. In the US the latter 2 are regulated by the CFTC (because these types of commodities can be volatile and futures are very useful for smoothing this market). A security is different from a commodity. The Howey Test for a security is: (1) investment in a (2) common enterprise, for (3) profit, from the (4) effort of others. NFTs have 2 options. They can be intrinsically useful (see ENS, which uses NFTs to manage a decentralized domain system for web 3). This most often means, be cool to look at. Or they can be given utility. For example, being a lifetime pass to a series of events or be a tokenized version of some person's time (e.g. buy my NFT and I'll mentor you for 1 hour, which some famous business people are doing). The other option, which too many are doing without registering, is being externally useful by deriving financial gain for holding the NFT. Buy (invest in) our NFT to join our community (common enterprise) and you'll get pre-access to more NFTs / derivative tokens that the core team creates (effort of others) that you can sell (profit). 

NFTs are property. The US has 200+ years of legal history managing property as securities. The people launching NFTs without thinking through the legal side are ignorant of history. Land (i.e. property) speculation from 1800-2008 has ironed out nearly ALL the legal problems stemming from NFTs with roadmaps trying to convince people to get in early for profit. They're unregistered securities, many violating the DMCA too, and no, being a DAO doesn't prevent SEC rules 506 and 504 from applying to offerings (i.e. NFT mints). "

But a separate quantum risk is reversing hash algorithms. Not all hash algorithms are quantum resistant. But Keccak which Ethereum uses (SHA-256) coincidentally is, as there is not 1:1 relationship between inputs and outputs. So going in reverse gets you a non-finite amount of potential inputs. Hypothetically a quantum machine could get stuck finding infinite numbers of potential (and possibly invalid for the specific blockchain) inputs that hash to the public key. 

Quantum would be useful in removing the invalid ones (private keys must be 65 chars long and be compromised of only a:f and 0:9) but then you get into the problem I stated above ^ where speed of light limitations in fiber optics start blocking your theft attempts."

Even if you manage to brute force 1,000,000,000,000s of keys per second, you still have to (1) compute the public key, (2) check their balances which requires a link to the public blockchain (you can't just spam the etherscan API as that is rate limited even at institution levels to only millions per second and is subject to limitations in information throughput), and (3) initiate transfers to actually steal the money. 

Quantum could maybe possibly might be useful in steps 0->1 in the decades time scale, but there are other bottlenecks quantum isn't going to be useful for that will add decades of computational delay simply because of the limits of the speed of light in fiber optics telecoms cables.

0) There are individuals with overlapping goals. 

1) The goals would be achieved faster/better if the individuals were in a group.

2) The group would be best structured as a community (as opposed to a benevolent dictatorship which is what CharlieDAO is).

3) This community can agree on some subset of goals. 

4) Financializing the community supports achieving the goals beyond the harm it does to the individuals within the community.

5) Community quality does not grow with its size beyond a certain size.

Decentralization != 1000000s of suppliers. It's entirely possible that a free market can only sustain a small number of vendors because that's just how the unique economies of scale in that market hit an equilibrium. 

So I guess 2 notes: (1) proof of stake consensus is coming to Ethereum which will heavily decrease the computational requirements to run a node. (2) governments are actively working to improve domesticated manufacturing of chips for other security reasons. So it's not really like chip manufacturers are a cartel (yet). 

Hardware concerns are much more of a concern on high throughput monolithic blockchains like Solana. Not so much for the Ethereum max-modular roadmap where cell phones can one day to validation of blocks (proposer builder separation, more light nodes, faster verification, proof of stake, decentralized staking pools, etc.)"

The point is to have competition.

I am very happy that I am no longer limited to 0.01% savings accounts and a 401k with poor liquidity and terrible user experience. 

I can use a checking account, a credit card, and keep a variety of assets of a variety of risk profiles across self custody wallets, 3rd party smart contracts, and of course, regulated entities like coinbase with password protection and customer service.

The long term of web3 is about flexibility, modularity, and choice. 

One possible future I expect is a spectrum of highly regulated Roll-ups using Ethereum as a common settlement layer.

We could have VISA and MasterCard Roll-ups that feel very much like using Ethereum today, but with flat fees or even subsidized fees. They could even integrate with Coinbase NFT platform and have reversible transactions in case of theft, and legal censorship to prevent inappropriate images or scam coins from showing up in people's wallets 

Users who want a fully regulated experience with fraud protection can use this layer, and confidently know they can choose to exit at any time (with some caveats, eg. waiting periods to prevent fraud).

We could then have public Roll-ups like Arbitrum that don't have any of that reversibility, are fully censorship resistant, and users pay fees directly based on their demand for blockspace and the urgency of it. This may be where higher yield activities live or where most of the NFT market chooses to settle to avoid refund-scams.

All of this can share Ethereum in unique ways."

(1) decentralization is a spectrum

(2) blockchain as a shared data layer enables lower barriers to entry for competition 

(3) Ethereum is chasing a fundamentally modular design 

(4) the 3 above all go together and reinforce each other. 

OpenSea being 95%+ of the NFT market by sales volume is a huge centralization problem. In addition to that, they are also the preeminent API service for NFTs. Critical tools like Metamask use OS APIs to render images. So the article is correct in that there's a *practical* censorship risk when using these vendors.

But the blockchain still helps- because OpenSea uses Ethereum to post transactions, they are susceptible to competition at *extremely low barriers to entry*. 

Check out LooksRARE. They are a decentralized NFT marketplace that seeded their customer base by airdropping tokens to OpenSea users (and we know who uses OpenSea because the transactions are on chain!). 

This is a natural cycle: centralized vendors serve a key need, get too big (e.g., freezing transfers when they know they control 90% of the market activity), and then they face competition that springs up nearly overnight."

There are 180 currencies among UN recognized countries. Should there really be this many? How many have proven trustworthy across >20yr time periods? The list is small (unfortunately). 

Web3 will give anyone with internet access the means of storing value (digitally) where it cannot be taken by anyone without your private key. 

Governments can and will do the standard bans (or more politely called ""capital controls"") as they do today when citizens attempt to vote with their wallets in ways governments don't like them voting, including: banning on/off ramps like coinbase, mass surveillance, warrantless searches & seizures, internet shutdowns, and violent coercion to identify those being ""unpatriotic"" by not storing their meager wealth in the the local currency.

I think the promise of web3 as a foundational technology is generally being solved. 

Digital property rights (Ethereum) 
Immutable data (blockchain) 
Shared data layers (Ethereum, Roll-Ups, Decentralized Oracle Networks)
Compression, access, and costs ( Cryptography, Zero Knowledge Proofs, Roll-Ups, content-based lookups). 

The problems right now are in getting this stuff to be usable by regular people in ways that deserve trust. Upgradeable proxy contracts are fundamentally sketchy- but they are critical for organizations like AAVE which use smart contracts for autonomous lend/borrow systems that hold BILLIONs of dollars of value. 

So we already see tradeoffs being made to bring things to users (here, immutability is sacrificed to enable emergency powers). 

There's also a massive need in cybersecurity, code auditing, and provably safe code for foundational ""LEGO"" pieces of the system to work. 

Most of this is going to be solved in (Decentralized) Finance first because that's where the money is (both literally and in terms of potential - automate out all the VPs)."

(1) There's restructuring the global financial system to be credibly neutral, maximally automated, and regulated only a priori publicly auditable user consented (open source) code & the DAOs who organize and manage the development of that code.
 
I personally don't own Bitcoin.

The revolution is not Bitcoin. The revolution is individuals being able to vote with their wallet and refuse to hold the currency of governments who have repeatedly proven to be untrustworthy with the printer. 

Bringing digital US Dollars (which cannot be taken from you unless you reveal your private key) to the average person in Venezuela, Sudan, Yemen, Iran, Argentina, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, etc. is a true revolution. 

Unfortunately, it also encourages US financial imperialism, but it's a macro/micro tradeoff. If you literally can't eat because your wages are sticky (slow to change with inflation) and groceries are not, you're going to dream of being able to avoid your country's capital controls and access dollars as a real store of value. My personal opinion is that long term, this option will force better governance. You can't embezzle in a currency your citizens refuse to use. 

2) Then there's the grassroots independent media movement where anyone can monetize a following of true believers (the 1,000 true fans hypothesis) using credibly neutral infrastructure and tools like NFTs to create co-ownership with the fans (and no... Bank, PayPal, Etsy, etc. have numerous cases of not being credibly neutral for creators). It's not just about anti money laundering and know your customer laws. I understand why those laws exist. It's about reducing the false positive rate. If you're incorrectly flagged on a platform that is 30-60% of your income, and it takes 4-6 weeks to resolve, you're at risk of homelessness. If we want a creative, artistic, expressive society, we need to enable that activity to actually fund living in our society. 

3) The more corporatized (and thus more media popular but in my opinion not actually that common in practice) use cases like: monetized gaming, supply chain, internal bookkeeping, shared data layers/ledgers.

This 3rd one I think is the most overhyped relative to it's progress. Why would a company use Ethereum when they could just use a permissioned AWS QLDB with their vendors?
Is IPFS really more uptime than multi-region S3? 
Is an NFT that gives you a plot of land in an MMORPG with only 400 daily users but $4B fully diluted value really worth $4000-12000? 

The reality is money has been very cheap since 2008 (look at the Fed interest rates since 1970... It's nearly straight down 😂). When money is cheap, institutions hunt for speculative plays and invest in a 100 VC funds with the hope that 1-2 can do 1000x.

I personally care most about (1), as an economist. And I'm building products that make it easier for anyone with an internet connection to get value from even the smallest amount of assets. I care about (2) as a force for improving the market for creative expression. I don't give a sh*t about (3). I have a few game NFTs, I probably should sell, but I like the creator and want to support their game. 🤷 I think most private blockchain use cases are better off being correctly designer AWS pipelines.

1) belief frETH price will rise. 

2) Desire for frETH for his own ability to withdraw early. 

3) Desire to burn frETH to get a share of the new supply of FRZ revenue token. (The new reason added into the tokenomics).

I've done a bit of sleight of hand by combining his micro-econ reasons to buy frETH, into the macro-econ reason for frETH to be bought overall.

The market of all Bobs combined, has a 4th reason to buy frETH. 

(4) A high frETH price incentives locking ETH & selling frETH. This is where you get real impact on the ""lowering circulating supply"". 

An individual Bob buying (many) frETH has more internalized benefits for him than buying 1 ETH does (all else equal). But it's still very small. But many Bob's together changes the game."

""If you wouldn't buy at $X, you should be selling at $X"". 

I fall for this trap all the time. I try to hold assets I have an emotional attachment to, without realizing that ""if this drops 30-50%, I'm probably going to sell it before it gets worse"". 

Then it drops 30-50% and I sell (typically, I like to tweet that I'm selling because I have a really good ability to sell at the worst possible time right before everything jumps). 

Because I'm focused on Deep Freeze, I really don't have the time to be watching a lot of assets and trying to catch knives & time markets perfectly. So I've been focusing on long term holds and things *I actually use*. 

I've definitely gotten burned hard for forgetting that rule, and will probably continue to get burned for it long term. Oh well."

And of course, just because supply is restricted doesn't mean demand will remain the same (and thus increase price). 

This is a mechanism for people to bribe people to reduce supply; but a decreased demand in excess of supply reduction is still a price reduction. 

Currently, there's no product that allows for anonymous payment to reduce circulating supply of an asset (except for buying it and hoarding it yourself, which is the most expensive way to restrict supply).

Also, there's the reality that plenty of ETH is in long term storage and *isn't circulating* currently. There's no way to estimate this though (you can use time since last move but that's just a proxy). This is on-chain evidence that some amount of ETH will not move. This evidence has a value for the market's information flow.

Thanks for bringing that up."

My hypothesis is that locking 1 ETH away for 1 year should be analogous to the 1 year staked ETH APR (the ""implicit"" rate of return of ETH) after the proof of stake transition / merge. Those are estimated to be 3-5% paid in ETH. 

I think if frETH can maintain a value of 0.02-0.04 ETH, that would be sensible to me. 

The returns on FRZ are another story entirely, those are a function of the broader market's impatience. As that is pure finance theory. 

The net present value of a stream of payments (here, the payments are frETH early withdrawal penalties + ETH early withdrawal penalties). 

But it's all a function of ETH's price, it's volatility, the market's desire to reduce its circulating supply, and the market demand for FRZ by burning frETH."

Why not double dip and do aETH or yearnETH?

Because this is about bringing yield to low risk LONG TERM holders of raw ETH. Contract migrations eat up gas. And custodial contracts are too risky to set & forget for multiple years.

13/ FAQs # 2

Won't everyone just dump frETH??

Yeah maybe! Then the price falls. But it doesn't matter.

1 frETH = [1 ETH removed from circulating supply for 1 year]

The market can price the bribe value. People are still forced to be patient. There is a natural equilibrium to be reached as the lower the price of frETH, the lower the *cost* of impatience (and impatience pays stakers). It also lowers the cost of future revenue (FRZ).

14/ frETH Tokenomics

Doesn't the supply of frETH go up forever as it's earned?

That was a problem originally, earned frETH was only removed by impatient people withdrawing early. But the new Curve style drip gives more pressure to remove supply, by burning it for revenue FRZ.

15/ FRZ Tokenomics

FRZ holders/stakers get their revenue diluted as new FRZ enters the market. This is a bribe too. By accepting dilution, it triggers a battle to burn frETH.

This gives frETH buy pressure, which is critical for liquidity."

Yes. But I would maybe tweak this definition. It's not about not caring about ownership. 

A $1 has a serial number, example: B03542754F
An NFT has a serial number too - example: 0x704bf12276f5c4bc9349d0e119027ead839b081b/3248

Both have meaning.

On a $1, The B corresponds to being issued by the Federal Reserve of New York.

On an NFT, the first section [0x704...81b] corresponds to the ERC-721 smart contract and the [3248] corresponds to the ID number in that contract.

You can actually have fungible non-fungible tokens. Fungible just means Interchangeable.

$1 = $1. 

I have NFTs where the ID # is relevant because it corresponds to specific metadata about that NFT and its possible features of that metadata lead to different market valuations. 

I also have NFTs where the ID # is completely irrelevant. All of them are the exact same with no difference in aesthetic or utility. 

In both fungibles and fungible NFTs (hate typing this lol) - you may find that people pay a premium for arbitrary reasons.

Quarters before 1964 had real silver in them, often more silver than $0.25 worth in today's silver prices. But for currency purposes, they are fungible."

My point is that businesses that are natively ""on-chain"", connected with oracle like Chainlink to connect on-chain and off-chain information, create a shared data layer. 

Right now blockchain is all ""money LEGOs"". You stack financial primitives to create automated financial systems that compete directly with banks & hedge funds. 

That's expanding into media with NFTs and platforms that make on-chain NFTs native to the media creation, distribution, and financialization process. 

This will eventually expand to entertainment & gaming. The broader ""Metaverse"". 

Once you get beyond ""money"" LEGOs into media & game LEGOs. You can start building towards ""Business as a Service"" becoming composable. 

Right now, vendor management, product offerings, product pricing, etc. for most software as a service & business as a service is very customized & in economic terms monopolized. 

If you have Salesforce, you're with them and their ecosystem. Sure you can try to piece together different parts of their ecosystem mixed in with other competitor ecosystems but that's an illusion of resiliency. They're not actually designed to be composable. 

As products get more and more streamlined, and as public blockchains become a means of ""competitor collaboration"" we'll see more and more standardization of products and services. 

The future is maximum composability. Eventually, stacking businesses on top of each other will be as fluid as it is today to stack financial products on top of each other. 

It's hard to describe in detail cause there's so many possible ways to do this. It could also be hampered by: 

1) regulation
2) refusal to innovate out monopolization

2) the market not actually caring about this and it not being profitable

I'm just illustrating one potential way web3 could lead to more specialization, more composability, and ""business LEGOs"". Which is more than just software as a service. "

They launch tokens, people (mostly fans but also speculators who may not consume the content but believe the person's audience will grow) can buy/hoard the tokens, and this provides both a revenue stream and a broader market cap for the person's efforts. 

This is probably an illegal securities offering, but the regulators are asleep at the wheel here unfortunately. 

Alternatively, NFTs that gate ""premium"" content is probably the future. The utility from gating content gives some protection for the securities concerns, since you buy it to directly use it; but the re-sellability still needs to get hashed out in courts. 

Overall there's a lot of NFT groups trying to help artists find their ""1000 True Fans"" using blockchain tech. I'm optimistic it'll get sorted out. 

I should note though- that the top 1% getting disproportionate revenue is not likely to change if they are also getting disproportionate [attention / sales / views].

I think what happens is businesses will see that credible neutrality gives them an opportunity to multiply their data. If they contribute (some kind of agreed upon anonymization of) data, they will get multiples more data (from both competitors and non competitor other companies using similar data for a similar piece of their product stack). The specialization is in the business use of the multiples more data- and then new businesses will form having specialized in this data because it'll be profitable to form a very specific niche across multiple product categories/companies. 

If 100 different companies are doing deliveries (food, consumables, medication, paperwork), and 90 of them use image processing & geolocation to confirm those deliveries, and appropriately cleaned data on that is openly available, then niches will form, and it will be profitable for maybe 50-80 of those companies to use the specialized service for image processing & geolocation; and only the biggest 10 will do it all in-house (and maybe those 10 don't contribute data... in which case maybe the other 90 organize a permissioned exchange method to exclude them- lots of possibilities)."

[conditional payments]
[product ordering]

So then what value does the public component do for a gamer?""

Transferability & ""true"" ownership that persists outside the game/platform. 

Are these valuable? Only in some small collectible sense; they still need a source of utility. Open source makes adding utility easier. But it's not a panacea."

Most games don't need them. Most games will use them as a means of getting rich off regular people who get left holding the bag for something nobody wants or stops being useful. 

GTA 3 NFTs would maybe have value if people could have used them across GTA 3, 4, 5 and there's an expectation of that continuing going forward. An NFT would make the GTA 3 asset transferrable and collectible. But it doesn't make it render as the same exact object in future games (the game has to choose to render it as w/e).

The public component would be most useful if GTA 3 was open source. Then a community of GTA 3 NFT owners could choose to build on it, create mods, and develop a marketplace around mods. Oblivion & Skyrim mods come to mind.

If it's not open source, then the public component is weakened, but still keeps the fundamentals - a community of owners can choose to give it utility some other way. Realistically, again, without a platform most of these things are collectibles with no value. Which is why I think P2E is a bad framework. 

When I think of Oblivion/Skyrim mods & NFTs- I think about the financialization of the mod community. Would people *choose* to fund mods using blockchain? Maybe."

The image is just a fun quirk, although the database may have some attributes. The main thing is that the database (held publicly in a smart contract) distinguishes a community of owners. 

Bored Ape Yacht Club isn't valuable b/c it's funny ape pics. It's valuable because the community of owners does events, gets sponsorships, gets celebrities to buy them, etc. It's a luxury good. 

So, yes, ideally if fortnite was to recognize BAYC it *should* have some attributes persist (hat, moustache, etc.) But it doesn't really have to. They could say, ""any BAYC gets you the 1 special Collab Fortnite skin"". 

The spectrum of value starts at recognizing the community from the public blockchain within a private game. 

As for in game assets, they'd have a few components. 

(1) the platform component, which relies on the game engine to render. 

(2) the blockchain component, which provides a means for digital scarcity and transfer. 

(3) visual representation, typically via a JPEG on IPFS.

Games that have persistent assets like MMORPGs will struggle to have only useless assets as ownable. 

So within gaming, there will be certain types of games that can get away with less useful assets than others. 

As for collaborative competition- it still has pyramid aspects of course, as you're going to have assets that gain utility also gain price and then there will be speculation on which assets will get 2nd game, 3rd game, Nth game giving it utility. 

And note: we don't need any attributes of the NFT to persist across games (a cross engine T shirt is a lot of dev time). It doesn't have to look the same or even act the similarly across games. Just be recognized across them in some useful way. 

The point is that right now, game assets have single sources of utility- the game that created them. 

But getting from a monopoly world to a 2+ world is a massive jump. The jump from 1->2 is bigger than the jump from 2-10+. Because it opens up a world of startups, community created games, etc. Paying CAC directly to their target customers and bootstrapping their games off of other games. 

People will have more options, those options will be more niche, and people will find the most entertaining thing for their taste.  "

One thing on the todo list is to figure out which specific tweet likely triggered this viral event and what components of it are reproducible (or not).

(1) low, fixed interest rates.

This is kind of a given nowadays, you can walk into a bank and get a  5% fixed loan for a mortgage and some even without a down payment. 

(2) the city is minimally well run

If the city you buy in goes bankrupt or has some insane natural disaster or is overly reliant on a specific industry (or even single corporations) or decides to spike property taxes youre going to be adversely effected. 

(3) you dont mind forgetting its an investment

Fundamentally, the value of owning property is that you extract value from future people (possibly not yet born) with current value. 

You have to *realize* the gains. 

So if there arent new people being made (US population had its first negative year with covid) youre going to need your property to be better than alternative properties and thats a bet on the city, your patience, and your renovations of course. 

Relatedly, real estate is rarely this liquid. You can sneeze near a realtor right now and get 10 profitable offers in 80%+ of the US right now. 

This may not hold if the government is forced to get more involved in the market to incentivize more development as there arent enough homes where people want to live, and too many homes in ghost towns everyone is leaving.

Having said this, I own my home in the probably the most recession proof area of the US (DC), and could probably sell for 30%+ gain tomorrow. 

I wouldnt buy the home I bought in the condition I bought it in at current market prices, tomorrow though. "

1) it pays to use things 

Competitors will look at users of products and literally pay them to acquire them as users. This sounds crazy, but it shouldn't. People who've done sales & marketing should get it immediately. Give CAC to target customers. 

2) communities of users are easier than ever to build

This does NOT mean, *profitable* communities are easy to build. Targeting *builders* will always be harder than targeting *users*. But there's a logic to rewarding the most active people at the forefront of a technology. And eventually the tools & analytics will get better for targeting certain customers over others. 

3) we're very early 

It took Google over a decade to get a 90% market share in the search market. It took OpenSea months. Once the big tech companies wake up to the opportunity they will have literally everything at their disposal- more product managers, more engineers, more money, more everything. 

And they'll be in the best position to use these same CAC strategies to take market share. 

If you're someone who cares about community driven development and/or someone who doesn't want to tech giants to own this new iteration of the internet then you especially need to be paying attention and working to build natural moats. 

The only moat in web3 is a loyal community of customers."

I do think it's cool but I don't see the UX getting to the point where people use an EVM wallet and also LN when an EVM wallet can hold more assets, is equally as cheap on a roll up and qualifies people for airdrops / marketing related to on-chain activity. 

I think what LN is doing in El Salvador is a cool example of an alternative payments system for a country that is trying to de-dollarize itself, but at the end of the day, finance is not just payments. It's also yield. 

LN doesn't really even compete with Eth and EVM assets, it competes with Coinbase commerce, stripe, PayPal/venmo, cashapp/square, and soon VISA which is making an EVM roll-up as well. 

I'm not against Bitcoin developing but frankly, the culture of Bitcoin is anti-use cases. It's HODL HODL HODL. Eventually network security will lose its issuance subsidy and fees won't be enough to incentivize miners (of course, it's possible nation states or large corps adopt it and operate at some kind of loss) but then we're in an even worse position than proof of stake. 

I think Bitcoin can be the buyer of last resort for energy anywhere, but the (loudest parts of) the community are anti building, anti change, anti competing digital property rights systems.

Don't worry, if there are cheapskates who (1) want things free and (2) have valuable attention, we can be certain there will be some intermediary willing to cover the costs if (2) is high valued enough (currently the primary means are ads, but web3 is about having way more options than just ads).

Banks want to play ball. It's governments that are stressed. 

Banks create money by undercollateralized lending against their reserves (deposits). Being able to access web3 and create their own stablecoins would be a massive boost to their bottom line. 

Governments control money by fiddling with interest rates and reserve ratio requirements (increasing/decreasing loan costs and increasing/decreasing amount possible to loan). 

Web3 w/ widespread stablecoin usage would create free floating interest rates and protocol determined reserve ratios (e.g. AAVE only allows up to 80% of collateral value to be borrowed against).

So it's the other way around."

The protocol is determined by the EIP process and core developers and the ETH clients (software) that are made. Ethereum has multiple clients which gives it resiliency and forces more coordination and review for any large software changes- which depending on the change, is either a soft-fork (doesn't invalidate previous versions of software) or hard fork (requires upgrades that invalidate past versions of the software). 

The Merge will be a hard fork. EIP-1559 was a hard fork. But because client core teams coordinate regularly to ensure they don't develop in a way that's harmful to other clients, hard forks are generally quite smooth unlike the DAO incident that created Ethereum classic. 

Consensus is about getting fake blocks through. You actually need more like 67% of the validators to collude to break ETH post merge. There's a metric called nakamoto coefficient that is somewhat related to this as a measure of decentralization. 

The trilemma is real, ETH focuses on security & decentralization. Scale is coming through Proof of Stake transition, Roll-ups that inherit security by posting their data directly to ETH, and sharding."

Something like 40-60% of global labor hours are filler/non-productive. And unfortunately they make a disproportionate amount of the income. Disintermedation & automation of those kinds of jobs should unlock a LOT of time & value for everyone.

I don't see people wearing glasses that watch their eyeballs to navigate the web, but I could be wrong 🤷. Just feels like pokemon go was a local top for AR.

So for me, when I think of digital things being relevant in the real world, I think: 

Community & Events. 

Owning a certain NFT should explicitly get you *off* the internet. That's a successful NFT to me. It gives you tickets, discounts, activities, people to meet.

An NFT is a distributed database mapping [token ID => Owner]. Where only the owner can designate changes to the mapping of the token ID's they own.

That database only has value if its given utility by a community. Typically, it's a community of people who also have a [token ID => Owner] mapping within the same database (the NFT's contract address). 

The vast majority of NFTs have little to no community and little to no utility. 

The technical breakthrough is that because these databases are public, and the Owner has on-chain activity that allows you to characterize them as someone who does certain [behaviors] (e.g. own competitor NFTs or do a lot of crypto trades on-chain) ANYONE can choose to add utility to a database. 

I can target all the owners of Mutant Ape Yacht Club (of which I know Josh is a member), send them an airdrop of tokens, and hope some % of them use my product. 

This enables customer acquisition cost (CAC) to be paid directly to target customers. It's a multi-billion dollar innovation in marketing, sales, advertising, community building, etc.

Not all JPEGs should be NFTs- image NFTs are honestly the low hanging fruit of NFTs, the tech is way beyond just images. 

Not all communities should be tokenized, it's probably a securities law violation to financialize certain types of communities. 

BTC/ETH are great assets, but it's like accepting gold. We probably want to use a stablecoin for most exchange, although in the near future, the friction to switch between assets will be so small, that it'll all effectively be the same experience no matter the currency. 

Login with Web3 wallet is 100% correct, it's disgusting how much we expose our emails, passwords (which people re-use too much), date of births, locations, social security numbers, security questions, etc. to companies who have 0 need for it.

It's a weird circular problem of high property tax = more school funding = better schools = higher home values = higher property tax. 

I don't think public schools should be funded differently based on the wealth of the locality. Seems to defeat the point of the word ""public"" in public schools. But that's a whole side debate. "

That's a whole debate. We see some states go heavy on property taxes and low on consumption taxes (sales, alcohol, similar taxes). Then we see other states do the exact opposite. 

Florida has no state income tax but property taxes and properties are insane relative to median incomes. This is different from California. 

The reason many are biased towards property taxes is because the supply function of land is not deterred by taxation. You have the same amount of land regardless of how it's taxed. 

Of course, *the thing built on the land* is super elastic to property taxes and you can easily overtax and lose development. 

So it's common for land and ""improvements"" (buildings) to have different tax regimes for certain zones. "

We see this today where cities with better farmable land are more dense than cities with worse farmable land (Chicago is denser than Phoenix). 

Within a city, same underlying economics, central land versus non centered land. Or land by water vs land by an airport. 

Two pieces of land have different *alternative uses*, it is these alternative uses that provide rationale for different valuations and prices. 

So it's not as simple as both being zoned residential. If one is zoned residential but is 5 minutes from a business district, it's going to have a higher alternative use value than a residential zoned house 30 minutes from a business district. 

I understand I'm not exactly answering the ""why tax it differently"" part, but it's all tied together. 

The value of the land is market determined, the tax assessment uses this for context because it does have other impacts (roads near business districts do get used more than faraway roads. They need more water management, more waste management, more policing, etc.) "

It's the digital version of shoveling coal (in the 1960s you could have 0 education and walk-on to make $2/hr; equal to about $18-20/hr today).

Most professions have barriers to entry (mostly BS, some legit) that reduce supply flow (new entrants adjusted for retirees) and the incumbents have an incentive to push for those barriers to be raised.

P2E games will be especially at risk of governance attacks- so for me, I'm watching the DAO tooling space before I get too into P2E, as it seems especially messy and risky imo. I would even push most people to invest in the blue chips before looking into P2E.

Once you make it legit, the supply of labor will insanely outpace the demand (especially as every new game drops VC subsidized liquidity & token incentives, a large % of the activity will be yield chasers not even people who *enjoy the game* lol).

I think P2E and NFTs are going to be a boom to gaming, but mathematically, they can't really make too many participants a living wage.

Just like how every 9 year old today thinks they're going to be a YouTube influencer when they grow up.

Similar to the pushback Ubisoft got even more recently. 

The rabid anti web3 crowd has been maliciously taught that NFTs destroy the planet (they don't, proof of work use a lot of energy, but proof of stake NFTs use effectively 0 energy) and that all crypto is ponzi scams (to be fair, if you search crypto on tiktok or youtube, you will get the most popular influencer garbage that I would never buy).

The problem is that these customers are bullying companies into not servicing customers that disagree with them. I'm not sure how Web2 companies pivot to Web3 without educating their current customers first and making it acceptable to them that they need to grow their business."

A lot of the biggest Web3 products heavily rely on centralized services like Cloudfare, AWS, etc. These services have actually been attack vectors multiple times for dapps, a Cloudfare API key caused a front-end attack on BadgerDAO that led to massive losses that weren't covered by smart contract insurance (web3 insurance doesn't cover web2 hacks :/). 

So in some ways, you have to wonder what's actually possible. 

Is it possible to have a decentralized S3? Yes, IPFS. 
Is it possible to have a decentralized EC2? Eh, technically, but not at a price point even remotely reasonable (we're talking 1000x+ costs).

For many, a web3 discord would just be a web2 discord that posts its archive to IPFS periodically, uses NFTs to segment channels & access, and then uses an ETH roll-up for value transfer. 

There's web hooks in discord today (e.g. collab land) that can jerry-rig this kind of stuff together using separate tools like login with metamask linking it to a discord handle."

1) I have a few DAO tokens, I don't care about their price, I'm actually voting in these very specific DAOs, e.g., PieDAO

2) stocks allow you to vote too (depending on the ""class"" of shares), nobody reads Prospectus (not even hardos like me), they just trust their 401k managers to do it. 

3) some DAOs are getting ahead of these problems through vote delegation (e.g. ENS which I've talked about many times) and DAO owned liquidity (which has risk tradeoffs relative to incentivized community liquidity). 

4) eventually, we'll see web3 native technology replace web2 stopgap tools like discord which is anti-web3 😂

5) eventually the political apparatus will do something to update these laws, which will (if the US leadership actually does their homework and does the smart pro-US dollar move) regulate these entities as the special startups they're trying to be and not pigeonhole them into existing securities laws that don't apply. 

I'm optimistic, but I'm not delusional. We're very early and the space is very underregulated and chaotic. Proceed with caution. "

I think the future is a mix of edge computing + zero knowledge proofs (e.g., zk-SNARKs) + credibly neutral computation. 

I imagine a future of people opting into to having their passive computing devices (everything from cell phones to tablets to work desktops) connected to some kind of credibly neutral set of applications - your device receives [data] + [instruction] and it outputs [result] and posts it to the application. 

Zero Knowledge Proofs enable us to confirm the instructions were followed exactly, edge computing is the idea that we do the computation as close to its end destination as possible (e.g., a model that chooses which ad to show a cell phone user, would calculate the optimal ad choice either on that device itself or on devices in the same geographic area), and then roll up technologies can serve as credibly neutral ground to post calculation results and store the outputs on either a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum as compressed call data) or a private database (e.g. S3). 

It's a super complicated problem, that's for sure."

🕺💃 Note: I never said I was an expert!

How does web3 solve data collection? By giving consumers choice!

You can buy a TV online with a traditional retailer, give them more info than strictly necessary, and get spammed forever, or you can use a web3 solution, one I haven't used & am no longer invested in (which I discuss in the micro book you didn't click the link for 💃🕺) SPI - allows you to make purchases on Amazon or Walmart with only crypto. 

Submit an address of delivery, pay with crypto using your preferred wallet, then get the goods. If there's a problem, SPI coordinates it with you. Amazon never gets more than your address & SPI never gets anything except your transaction hash proving you paid for the order # generated.

Data segmentation preserves privacy. 

Personally, I don't mind Amazon and don't mind them tracking my data as they've proven to be good stewards and have good recommendation engines. 

Web 3 is very early, there aren't a lot of good solutions for real word purchases, but I'm hyped for the possibilities.

Facebook sells ads based on strong emotion: angry reacts, lots of likes, strong semantic headline. 

Instagram sells ads based on strong affinity: celebrities, influencers, similar users click similar ads. 

TikTok- which I think is the future of advertising and influencer culture uses both & community. 

They pay creators (subtle difference from influencer) to produce and then products pay the same creators to include them. 

This is especially common in clothing, where some creators primary thing is fashion videos & product reviews. Similar to YouTube but better aligned to the ""everyday"" person's aesthetic.

- no content reusability (a nightmare to find old content, content expires fast, although they've been working on extending this) 

- shares are shadow banned (to prevent things going viral, shared posts are treated as 3rd class posts)

- groups are useless - literally don't use them 

- newsletter is broken, also they monopolize the email list, so you can't leave the platform with your readers. 

- connection/follower distinction is outdated and they won't fix it
- articles aren't SEO optimized so they don't get read externally and like groups, don't get used internally.

- can't decide if they want profiles to replace resumes or be a post history (like Twitter) 

- analytics are 19th century (not a typo), effectively useless until you pay a lot of money and even then third parties like shield are 1000x better.

Truly, the worst of Twitter combined with the worst of Facebook. 

They need to: 

- end groups / articles
- buy substack and integrate it fully to replace newsletters (add twitters ""notify when this user posts"" & lists) including full portability of follower emails.

- make profiles significantly more customizable (and actually keep pinned content, not randomly resetting it when they update the servers...)

- allow shares to be first class citizens

Their only focus is on engagement optimization and selling recruiting SaaS. They don't actually have a deep product vision for enabling economic opportunity globally.

Then there's time weighted average pricing (TWAP) which is similar to DCA but meant for minimizing value lost to slippage on large orders. 

I'm kind of ignoring both of those and focusing on the idea of having an amount you want invested, and trying to maximize the value gained- which is slightly different than aligning to your cash flow or avoiding loss from large orders."

AAVE is the first time in my life I ever used a collateralized debt position. This is something corporations and high wealth individuals use regularly to make strategic investment decisions that pay off tremendously. 

Now regular people can do that too. 

Outside of finance, NFTs enable digital property rights systems that allow for artists to tokenize discrete service offerings and have them priced in a free market. Enabling them to build communities more efficiently and at lower costs relative to the traditional media industry (where you had to get signed by records and get locked in predatory contracts & lose your creative freedom).

Deposit funds, borrow with collateral, they take the spread as revenue. There's a core team and investors, but the code is fully open source. As a result, tons of clones have come around with different business models. For example, Geist copy/pasted AAVE and then instead of a core team keeping the spread, people stake Geist tokens to earn the spread. 

No investors no core team, just copy/paste tweak the business model. 

Is AAVE going to collapse? No, because people value their innovation and the market of users is happy to let them keep the spread in exchange for an increasingly advanced product. They're the market leader through pure market consensus, not any closed source monopolization of their product. 

Of course, this only works for software, you won't see this for hardware. But as we get further down the pipeline of abstracting hardware from credibly neutral computation, we'll see more and more software be open source, community driven, and profitable- even when copy/paste forks are easy."

This is a UX problem. Would I rather give Google my identity or $X/year? Well, the former, takes 30 seconds, the latter, they either don't even offer an ad free / privacy preserving version, or if they did, it requires the hassle of signing up, setting recurring payments, etc. 

I agree RE: core hardware. But credibly neutral computation (which is what the Ethereum state machine enables, albeit prohibitively expensive for most computations right now) would allow someone to make a Gmail or Google drive or even Google cloud competitor with organized payment via pubic smart contracts. 

It's hard to fund open source because the UX isn't there. There's some great work from Vitalik Buterin on quadratic funding; there's open source financialization platforms like Gitcoin that enable communities of users to invest in open source and see profit from revenue streams (& of course, speculation). And I do think a culture shift is happening. 

Developers know open source is the best work, and closed source is mostly stitching together the value created from open source. We just need to financialize it."

These monopolies aren't that complicated. They prefer money over everything.

We see the rumblings of this stuff. Google open sourced Android and derivatives like Jio are becoming critical infrastructure in low & middle income countries (where phones often skip touch screen to reduce costs).

Facebook is building its walled garden Metaverse, but even Zuckerberg has acknowledged that Microsoft's failed attempt to create a walled garden internet (The Microsoft Network, MSN) in 1995 was a lesson for him in following user preferences- I expect natively open technology to become the norm. Facebook's metamerve must accept free flowing of users & their sovereign data in & out of their systems just to compete. 

We're extremely early on this stuff. I have 0 expectation that the next 100M users will touch Uniswap. That vast majority will use Fintech apps that custody their assets and whitelist the kinds of interactions they have in their apps. 

*But* it only takes a sufficient number of users demanding the ability to self custody and exit systems with their data as their own, to force these apps into setting up the rails to exit/enter them as users please. 

Coinbase is ahead on this, they know their custody business is not a century-long play. So they are building products to serve the whole spectrum of crazy TOR guys who use Linux that want a self custody wallet to the young woman investing a small piece of her paycheck in a fully custodied and insured Bitcoin ETF as part of her 401k. 

It took 11 years to go from Netscape to Amazon S3. Give it a few decades, making value transfer as native to the internet as information transfer is revolutionary, but revolutions are slow. "

Even if your model is 2x as accurate as local agents. Local agents can funnel below average homes to your average priced model and you would never have the data you need to know that ahead of time. 

Zillow is betting averages average out-- but nobody with an above average home accepts the average price.

Crypto is also subject to unique risks like flash loan attacks and poorly written code that leaves vulnerabilities in where user's funds are stored (see: Rekt, a blog site that tracks large hacks in DeFi).

This of course is not entirely unique to crypto, the SWIFT system in traditional finance has been hacked by North Korea for hundreds of millions of dollars and banks all over the world have to cover for edge cases like ransoms, transfers under duress, and even pirates. But in practice, deposit insurance is much more common and the day to day investing for regular people is much simpler in traditional finance.

The benefit of crypto is it's risk- the ability to completely control your own assets with no trusted third party. If your bank is told by authorities to freeze your account because your name sounds funny or matches a bad person- good luck ever accessing that again. Not to mention the grotesque rise in civil asset forfeiture (see: John Oliver's episode on this, it's disgusting). 

I don't think the future state is everyone being a full crypto cowboy that actually stores their entire wealth in fully self custodied wallets. But if crypto can bring: transparency, flexibility, portability, and credible neutrality to the finance system I think those are all massive positives that outweigh the risks (including the realities of money laundering and terrorist financing).

Agree 100%. I use Venmo with friends. Bitcoin is not the currency for average person in a strong, open economy. If your currency inflates at/under GDP growth, you're probably fine. It's better for people with 8% GDP growth and 25% inflation who literally can't get ahead in life because it's illegal for them to ""vote with their feet"" and leave bad countries & currencies.

2) a buyer of last resort for energy can increase energy prices, hurting regular people

Also agree 100%. Much like taxing pollution through carbon credits, raising prices is a mechanism to enforce more judicious use of energy. If people choose to build solar in the middle of nowhere because it's profitable with Bitcoin, then I expect a benefit we will all see is more innovation in solar panels. I'm an optimist and think that kind of innovation will transfer well to solar not in the middle of nowhere.

3) decentralization is for sketchy terrorists

Yeah, ransomware & terrorists & drug dealers love Bitcoin. They also love dufflebags of $100s. 🤷 It's hard. But I don't believe the guilty until proven innocent paradigm of tracking every person's every transaction is the right answer."

Realistically, this won't matter to your end buyer, as they're purchasing your unlockable content. Just something to be aware of if you are trying to be fully decentralized & not rely on OpenSea in the future.

If you used OpenSea Storefront (many do, to save money) then you don't actually mint the NFT on Ethereum (where it would get it's own contract address), instead your NFT is held within the OpenSea Storefront contract allowing it to be sold/bid on using only signatures. The negative of course is that it's under OpenSea's control.

The ""proper"" (expensive but fully decentralized) way to mint an NFT is to upload the image/file to IPFS for persistent data storage, spin up an ERC-721 contract yourself, and mint the NFT(s) with the IPFS URL in the Metadata for that contract-ID.

OpenSea will allow you to do it either way, but they have subtle ways of pushing people into keeping it under their control to save costs."

The trilemma is: 

Decentralization, Security, Scale. Pick 2.

Bitcoin prioritizes decentralization & security. And SegWit was the foundation for Lightning Network to work and eventually bring Scale. Every main blockchain competitor that scales well, gives up decentralization. Which I think is fine as long as we accept governments will regulate those nodes heavily and the chain will eventually lose credible neutrality (""you can't validate transactions involving these addresses known to be associated with sanctioned countries"").

I think China is going to look back and regret giving up their insane plurality on the Bitcoin hash rate, especially as they want to diversify their financial reserves away from US dollar. As for energy consumption, it uses a *lot* of energy. That's undeniable. My point is I think it's interesting to wonder what it would look like when the big bucks are actually trying to make it more energy efficient and how that would have positive effects for energy elsewhere. 

To get good at anything you need practice. Bitcoin is the absolute easiest way to practice energy, because you can finance energy creation without actually having to do all the infrastructure work of bringing energy to cities, people, corporations, and managing that infrastructure. 

All you need is a means to connect to pools and send calculations over. "

The transactions within blocks are immutable once settled (there's an entire attack vector called re-orgs, where miners can attempt to reorganize the transactions within recent blocks- this is natural given the competitive nature of choosing which chain of blocks to consider the ""correct"" chain). 

Block immutability is not related to the computational side of the blockchain. 

Miners run software called ""clients"" to choose transactions from ""mempools"" for inclusion in the blocks they produce and recommend for inclusion in the blockchain.

These clients can be pretty different in implementation, as long as the end result is blocks that are compliant with the blockchain's rules.

Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are ways for the community to recommend changes to the blockchain rules and how clients function to abide by those rules.

Some changes are backwards compatible and don't require every miner to actually agree to upgrade their client in order for new blocks to fit into the blockchain. These are called ""soft forks"" because. 

Some changes to a protocol are not backwards compatible and would require a ""hard fork""- the changes are so significant that you essentially have to make an entirely new blockchain that inherits all previous blocks and continues with the new software rules. 

Ethereum & Ethereum Classic are an example of a hard fork. Segregated Witness (SegWit) is another example for Bitcoin which led to the Bitcoin Cash fork. 

So, blocks being immutable is entirely different from block creation being mutable. For more, definitely look into the block size wars for Bitcoin 2014-2017.. "

Proof of Stake is much easier to regulate, as you can go directly to the managed node services (e.g., Blockdaemon) and subpoena them for records on their customers, enforce know-your-customer laws, tax the on-chain revenue, etc. I fully expect PoS to become the standard and for governments to get in on the action.

What would be entirely intolerable dishonesty is updating the blockchain to transfer someone's assets to yourself without their permission.

In Ethereum today, there is something called MEV- Miner Extracted Value (it technically exists in Bitcoin as well, but I don't understand MEV in that context much to be honest). The ability to choose which transactions make it into a block (and ultimately onto the blockchain) and in which *order* those transactions happen is an entire field of study with $100M+ impacts just on Ethereum.

Proof of Stake is, by design, insanely less energy intensive than PoW. But at the cost of being a centralizing force. It takes money to make money in Proof of Stake. In proof of work, you could at least theoretically get lucky by contributing a very tiny amount of hashpower (e.g., a raspberry pi) for a long period of time to a pool of miners."

PoW seeks to prevent intolerable dishonesty by making block production very energy intensive. PoS seeks to prevent this dishonesty by making you put up a pile of value that can be slashed for being dishonest.

Technically, in both cases, the reward for successful dishonesty is magnitudes of order higher than the cost, so that's why cryptography comes into play. 

Less technically- Proof of Work is interesting because it allows miners to be ""buyers of last resort"" for energy. Anywhere in the world with a minimum connection to the Bitcoin network can immediately convert excess energy into bitcoin by validating transactions on the network. 

Buyers of last resort can have very interesting and positive economic impacts on a market. For energy, having a buyer of last resort provides a floor price for energy; this can incentivize green energy (hydroelectric, solar, even nuclear), better energy storage (so you can wait until bitcoin price is high), and better energy utilization (by reducing ""cheap"" energy- as you always have Bitcoin who will pay a minimum price).

This is of course completely the opposite of everything mass media says about bitcoin."

Eventually as the hardware improves (glasses instead of a bulky box attached to your face) we'll see even more integration of digital content into the real world (often this is put under the sublabel AR- augmented reality). 

In addition to digital coming to real world, we'll see real world go digital. We already experience productive, collaborative work through tools like laptops, cameras, and Zoom. We also already see people create and maintain relationships with others entirely through social media. 

Metaverse is the complex fusion of these patterns with a new foundation layer: digital scarcity and thus digital ownership. 

The real world is unique because it is scarce. It takes people and energy to create things that are useful. While in the digital world it's as simple as copy/paste. 

Technologies like blockchain & NFTs will allow native value transfer on the internet and ownership of digitally scarce resources.

So the Metaverse is the future of owning, creating, transferring goods (both ""real"" and digital) in a digital & ""real"" world seamlessly.

I would just push back on the idea of what habit is worth building. I actually think posting is a bad way to grow a following. Much more effective to build your own ecosystem of people you follow, then add to them. Curate links, reply to their posts with those links, have conversation, etc. 

Most things have already been said, so I think you can contribute more to the ecosystem by concentrating on maximizing the highest reach stuff."

English as a second language bias is very much real. 

But as a brown person in the US, I literally watch subtle discrimination happen constantly. It's invisible to the people who don't experience it. Whether it's the black man at the airport getting questioned noticeably harder about his travel plans relative to the white woman who preceded him. Whether it's the brown woman followed around stores by staff on the assumption she might steal. Whether it's a trans person being glared at for using the bathroom they feel is appropriate for them.

Things don't have to be ku klux klan level racist for them to be blatantly discriminatory and harmful. 

The premise that diversity and competence are inversely related is an internalized supremacy mindset.

It could be pretty simple. All primary sources, e.g., recorded president speeches, are released by the relevant party (e.g. C-SPAN) as audio NFTs with frozen metadata. 

Anyone claiming to have recorded that speech and heard something else or doctoring it to say something else will, definitionally, not be C-SPAN and have metadata that is *after* C-SPAN metadata.

Decentralized non profits can exist. People submit money to a pile and vote on spending requests (e.g., a GoFundMe type of thing). Things that get enough votes get permission to withdraw from the pile. I coded a small dApp that does this in solidity.

Converting 50% of your pay to BTC is trivial, tons of apps like Coinbase with dollar cost averaging into coins. But the tax point is very real and a blocker for regular tax-fearing Americans like myself."

I look at the S&P 500 hitting all time highs during a global pandemic as a serious problem, I say it's indicative of too much cheap money chasing any place to be except cash. In a strong (high confidence) economy that money is put into new businesses not just inflating asset prices. 

I point to things like the S&P 500 / Fed Balance Sheet to support my argument that we're in a serious everything bubble and that speculation is running rampant. 

Economists that disagree with me tend to point to the global asset shortage. We've had decades where real economic growth has happened in countries with untrustworthy government and monetary policy. They're itching for trustworthy stores of value and they find ways to invest in our stock market accordingly. They note that the demand for US denominated assets (e.g., treasury bonds) far exceeds the supply. 

Essentially, that it's not inflation, it's globalization combined with disproportionate desire for US assets. They argue rising national debt, combined with low interest rates, is effectively not a problem, because the interest rate is fixed and denominated in a currency we control. 

I'm open to being convinced in favor of USD, but until then I believe staked Ethereum will become the global bond of the 21st century."

Yes & No. 

It's true that your wallet address is itself a function of your private key, such that someone with your private key (e.g., using a keylogger) could rob you blind. But at full maturity we should expect companies to form that manage multi-factor authentication for wallets and for users to be able to easily move between those companies. 

If a leak occurs, you simply make a new wallet address (takes seconds) and transfer all your assets to the new wallet (and in fact, the companies will likely proactively do that for you in case of breaches). Essentially throwing away a previous identity and starting over. 

Websites would track data at the NFT level, so you bring your data with you when you change wallets.

I actually think the net effect on cybersecurity will be that incidents plummet, because right now, even the websites I rarely ever visit are asking for critical information (e.g., date of birth) and leaking it (Target, Yahoo, Equifax, etc.). "

They couldn't build suburbia overnight AND convince people to invest their entire life savings in it without some kind of promise that it would be an investment (not an expenditure). 

So they created the modern US tax code that explicitly incentivizes real estate more than any other sector of the economy. They then further complicated the tax code to incentivize businesses to remain close enough to suburbs so that people wouldn't be overly mobile. 

A mobile labor force is a strong labor force, but capitalism needs weak labor. The best ways to weaken labor are: lock them into  fixed locations to restrict their job options & reduce unionization to restrict their collective bargaining."

Mktplace is a Decentralized Application I am developing to improve market information and second-party collateralization for any arbitrary set of assets. 

To really make this work requires skills I don't have. It also assumes a lot more information exists on the market for crypto assets than actually exist.

1) Things have value for multiple reasons. 

Houses are useful because they house people - Utility value.

Houses are useful because land is durable and the recordkeeping & legal system is strong so that you know who owns the house - Store of Value value. 

2) The Store of Value value is a major reason that speculation comes into the housing market. 

See: Massive amounts of foreign investment in Seattle, Vancouver, NYC, and other real estate markets. The houses are never occupied by the owner and often not even rented out. They literally just sit there empty. 

Why? 

Because people with money want to diversify their returns and where they store their money. 

This speculation is X% of a commodity's price. The Utility value is (1 - X)% of a commodity's price. 

3) NFTs are purely dominant (see Nash Equilibrium) in record-keeping and legal systems for maintaining ownership. 

Even if you copy/paste an NFT and make another one, that copy will fail to have the Ethereum Contract Hash Address of the original (that's how cryptography works).

Thus - for any commodity - a socially agreed upon NFT system for that commodity, should separate the X%, leaving only the utility ( 1- X%) value. Thus, deflation of assets."

The idea is the contract was poorly written to allow anyone call a certain very important function, that function checks if the person's information hashes to a certain value, but it only actually checks the first 4 bytes of the hash. 🤦🏾🤦🏾

Getting a collision on 4 bytes is only 2^32 brute force checks. A standard laptop can take random guesses over a few days and find a collision if only the first 4 bytes matter. Use some cloud computing or parallel processing and you can calculate hashes for a few hours and get a collision on that tiny of a hash. 

I'm leaning heavily toward inside job right now, but the hacker continues to gloat. 

They are now claiming they want to the return the funds (or at least the part that isn't locked or already given away), but you can tell their transactions to themselves (which are being watched by thousands) are someone who is clearly way over their head.

Well (1) I have to monitor my loan health factor. Because I don't make monthly payments, the way it works is I have to keep more ETH in my deposit than I have borrowed. 

If ETH drops in value, my health factor drops too. 

If it drops enough, I can get liquidated. 

Liquidated = they sell my ETH and pay off my debt.

The fee for being liquidated is 5%. 

So if I don't pay back my loan AND my collateral loses value beyond the health factor minimum AND I don't reduce my loan or add collateral within a certain time frame once liquidation begins- I can be liquidated. 

If a random stranger sees my collateral is insufficient and they want to earn the 5% fee, they trigger my liquidation and earn some money.
My debt is cancelled, but I technically paid my 4% APR + 5% fee for not maintaining my loan. 

No damage to my credit score or anything, all decentralized, all transparent, no administrators to argue with."

Dictionaries use hash under the table to make the lookup constant. This is exactly equivalent to an R environment. Normally, you can't iterate on a hash, but python dictionaries allow iteration by tracking keys() in the dictionary (this is usually memory inefficient). 

So yeah, named list & environments cover the Python dictionary. Python just fuses them by tracking the keys in a dictionary for you (to allow looping through). 

Normally you can't loop through a hash table because it's unordered."

It's one thing to smooth payments out for people so they can manage their cash flow- but that's not what those providers are doing.

It's like alcohol sales. 10% of alcohol drinkers make up 60% of alcohol sales. 

BNPL model is *not* to squeeze by on 4-8% APR and profit on user data (data -> ads -> make up profit). It's to get people in cycles of buying things they can't afford under the illusion they can afford it. The more people buy, the more kickbacks and late fees they can rake in.

At least a credit card builds your credit score- BNPL is the worst of credit cards without any of the benefit and targets people on the margins of credit.

The positive of Apple getting into the space is that at least they own a ton of the products people buy, so they arguably could afford to NOT exploit their buyers. But that might be a stretch too."

The idea being that *custody* of an asset is an underrated part of owning an asset.

Fractionalized ownership of art is a real alternative investment, but the reality is that you can't custody a fraction of a Monet. You're trusting that your email saying you have a piece of a Money represents the ability to sell your piece in the future (ownership = ability to sell). 

NFTs, existing on the blockchain, are (1) verifiably owned, (2) can be fractionalized officially through a smart contract and tokenization. 

So in reality, NFTs will completely eliminate the traditional fractionalized art ecosystem, not the other way around. We should expect museums to tokenize & fractionalize the art they own and make them available in metaverse compliant formats in the 3 - 10 year time horizon."

I am definitely more biased toward do-er/presenter. Documentation tends to be an afterthought for me, and as much as I like to think I can simplify things, I think of simplifying as more of a UX type of thing. Caring about how end users are abstracted away from the gnitty gritty of do-ers.

In terms of what's ""inevitable"" I think that's what everyone wants to know. The supply chain is so global and complex nowadays. It used to be that your inputs were local so your price exposure was local too (this is an important consequence for how we define ""advanced"" economies as those that are reliant disproportionately on capital and not labor; capital price exposure is significantly more difficult to localize). Prices could rise in one part of a country and not another, opening up arbitrage opportunity. Nowadays, everything is global and price exposure is globalized too. An oil delay like the Suez Canal, or a major traffic delays during Chunyun in China can cascade into price uncertainty everywhere at once. 

What do we need to reign inflation in? Frankly I don't think we know / can.

Then I met disability advocates who note that this job description primarily comes from companies who knowingly don't have ADA compliant office space and can't accommodate a wheelchair in everyday meeting (e.g., only a single conference room is ADA compliant and it's always booked). 

This small, innocuous reference to standard office tasks is actually a shield against having to do reasonable accommodations for someone, e.g. allowing an entirely productive wheelchair user to work from home most days, or give their meetings preferential access to the conference room that actually is wide enough for them to use in practice (and not just tape measure technically legal width).

DeFi is built on top of Ethereum. It uses Ether to pay for transactions (although complex direct to miner technologies like ArcherDAO are trying to circumvent this which is interesting and full of technical depth on how flashbots work and MEV fairness, etc.)

Andre Cronje, probably the 2nd most famous programmer in the space behind Vitalik, said it best recently: bull markets are bad for development. Anyone who actually wants to create a world changing DeFi project can't launch because within minutes someone with copy/paste their code and add a worthless governance token and now 90% of developer time is spent incentivizing the token instead of working on the protocol. 

Every effort to separate DeFi (useful tech) from Crypto (tokenization of a protocol's ""governance"") generally fails in these kinds of wild west conditions.

More practically, governance of a deFi protocol is the 2nd most important part of a deFi protocol. On Ethereum, smart contracts are permanent upon launch (unless explicitly coded to allow for injection of new rules or new owners, etc.) This means that every project is technically an isolated module. The narrative around which modules are a part of a single protocol (e.g. that ""Instagram"" is a Facebook product and not its own thing) involves community management (analogous to shareholder management), social media, marketing, etc. To make this work, you have to incentivize community participation and self dealt governance tokens propping up liquidity for itself through more rewards of itself (what I like to call self-dealing Ponzi APY) is the most common strategy to do this management. 

Point being, DeFi in practice today is 1000% reliant on Crypto because it is crypto that decentralizes the management of the financial protocols. 

The only alternative to this, Andre's strategy, is to build, launch, and let the broader community do whatever it wants and not worry about developer / product manager / core team monetization. I'm not sure that's sustainable. Most of these teams are themselves venture capital backed, which puts more pressure to gov token your way to venture capital profits.

I pay my taxes, my eth address is easily viewed by anyone, I'm entirely upstanding in all the relevant ways. 

RE: Digital currencies. They're fully transparent. They found the colonial ransomware hackers within weeks, following their address to the ends of the Earth (well, here California). It's the opposite really. Fully transparent financial transfers hide the bad in a lot of noise, but it's not actually hidden. Even on Twitter they have bots that post every single move that large wallets make (called ""Whale alerts""). Anti-money laundering is significantly easier when everything is public. The network analysis, full history, the bot tracking for when funds move to Exchanges, so many possibilities for automated systems and AI. Now, are the regulators at the maturity level to use these methods? Many are! It'll grow, there will be cyber firms building automation on top of this, it'll get easier and easier. 

The golden era of criminal using bitcoin on silk road is over in my opinion. Too many eyes. "

1. Transactions require mining; I think it's 100% fair to say that total transactions / total mining energy = average transaction energy. The obvious next question to contextualize is is: *is this going down?*, if so, good! if not, problem. 

2. If bitcoin buy pressure falls, then the HODL anti-sell pressure has to *more than match* that drop in buy pressure, because the marginal *cost* of mining matters a lot to miners who have to sell BTC to pay costs. It's 100% possible that in 20-30 years the price of bitcoin is not enough to cover the marginal cost of mining which leads to less decentralization. This should be on everyone's radar. I mean, in 2139 they'll be fighting for scraps of like 0.001 BTC right? There's no transaction recording without mining because mining records changes to the blockchain so I don't think its fair to entirely decouple them. 

3. Layer 2 solutions, some of them insanely centralized, even when storing transactions on Layer 1 are subject to the effects of block size and block frequency. BTC's 10 minutes and 1 MB can be SegWit'd to some extent, but it's not a panacea. "

But if 50-70% of the market is using a default gas price, then efficiencies from no longer optimizing whose transactions you include will be noticeable. Default bias is very useful. On Polygon for example to default is 1 gwei (in MATIC); I've never used another. Knowing that my transaction won't fail, I never worry about doing 5 or 8 instead. Unlike in ETH where I've been burned (pun not intended) a LOT from undershooting gas estimates and having my transactions expire. That costs real money. The result? I *overpay* constantly. 

EIP-1559 destroys the average user's need to constantly over-pay. A massive inefficiency.

Web 3.0 fixes this. If we treat money as information, then money becomes native to the internet. The reason we have ad based internet is because we didn't have a means of cleanly and trustlessly extracting value from the customers.

Bitcoin has proven to be the most decentralized, secure blockchain for this type of use case. The reason I say this is because blockchains sell blocks. As much as we complain about high fees, the fees of a network are security as a service.

ADA, Stellar, XRP are all wildly cheap *because* they don't pay for security as a service through fees. The only way to have low fees + high security is to either offload your security to a layer 1 (which MATIC does) OR have absurdly high number of transactions that allow for each individual transaction to have low fees (goal of ETH 2.0).

MATIC, which I am heavily invested in so let me note that disclosure, or ETH directly would have been my high level recommendation to be honest. I think it opens a lot more doors for decentralized finance & self-banking (as opposed to bitcoin, which realistically is just going to be an alternative investment/currency but not a yield generator).

In sales for example, # of calls is a measure but it's a bad one. Evidence shows extremely limited benefit to monkey dialing and that's what happens when you incentivize the wrong thing. 

But something like net revenue, or net revenue as percentage of gross revenue are metrics that good to game. Of course, you still have to worry about the marshmallow test (you don't want all your sales to be tiny, low hanging fruit and forget to set up bigger sales that take longer than a 1 sales cycle), but that doesn't make those metrics/targets bad at all! "

1. Quantity gives you lots of different resources to go back to. 

Given my self-imposed 2-hr time limit, I couldn't spend time re-visiting ggplot2 documentation, nor re-learn plotly. I had to remember the most relevant past project I had (here I used my Cereal repo) to copy/paste custom themes for ggplot2. Then I had to wrap them in ggplotly b/c I knew I wouldn't remember the plotly code directly LOL. 

2. Quantity helps you generate a variety of use cases. Better to have 50 things and 20 of them are quickly re-usable, than to have 3 amazing things, but they're so complicated you can't remember how to safely extract pieces out of them. This is even true for well documented and packaged things. My R packages are always clean and unit tested, but they're extremely specific, making them scalable but not necessarily flexible in a time constraint."

Two infinities can have the same Cardinality but not the same Measure. This makes them both comparable (same cardinality) and yet still one have *more* than the other.

See: 
""It is not true that all infinities are equal, but it is true that the interval (0,1) contains as many numbers as the interval (0,2). However, while there are infinitely many numbers in (0,1) and also infinitely many natural numbers, there are more numbers in the interval (0,1) than there are natural numbers.""

401ks at an individual level can be really smart. Free compounding of money you would've paid in taxes. 

So 19.5k vs like 15k post tax is 4.5k additional money compounding which adds up to >$200k over 20 years at 7% interest. 

That's excluding any match which is semi free money.

But at a macro level: 

1) they lock up assets. While recent legislation has made it easy to access 50% of your 401k, locking your 401k for 20+ (often nearly 40) years is a major commitment that is difficult to fully understand when you're first starting out.

2) they create inelastic buy pressure. People put $X into their 401k and then buy their index at whatever price it is. This disconnect between price & quality is really bad. Stocks that get lucky enough to be put into popular indexes get bought automatically by tons of people while those people don't actually read prospectus or even know what they bought.

Combining (1) and (2) you get extremely low sell pressure (which inflates asset prices) AND inelastic buy pressure (which inflates prices). 

I support people owning slices of the economy, but I'd prefer they do so while informed and with free access to Liquidity as they see fit. 

I think self-banking is the future and I hope to see updated legislation allowing people to create their own 401ks with liquidity untied to employers.

There's 3 categories here: 

(1) profitable efficiency gains

More renewables, more efficient transportation systems (e.g. freight), healthcare innovation, etc. 

These can actually reduce inflation because they *deflate* prices across large parts of the economy. 

(2) wealth transfers
Economies grow middle out, not top down. So if this is tax & spend funded with high income capital gains + financial transaction taxes. Then this will reduce asset prices (shrinking the everything bubble) and move money to consumption. Probably a good thing as the labor force participation rate has plummeted. 

(3) spoilage 

Unnecessary expenditures that don't benefit anyone. 


People are really pessimistic about government right now. They assume this will go 0%/0%/100% between efficiency, transfer, and spoilage. 

Realistically, small efficiency gains can make massive impacts. Post WWII saw the greatest age of middle income in US history. The middle never had it so good.

I'd be happy with a 40%/40%/20% ratio to be honest. I can understand how pessimists may say ""we'd be lucky to get 10/10/80"". But reality will probably be somewhere in the middle. "

Sure a lot of it is important (literacy, arithmetic) but let's be honest. It's socialization, babysitting, and test prep nowadays. Teachers have had nearly all their creative freedom ripped away from them for testing. 

(2) there's minimal psycho-social support. School to prison pipelines, bullying, food insecurity, counselors who's goal is to get you to college no matter what. Add in school shooter drills now too. 

If we rebuilt school from scratch it would be: 

Highly creative teacher-consultants that curate projects, and self-learning (my 4 year old brother can independently manage YouTube kids videos that have audio & visual components for learning, combined with pausing and rewinding... How can rote live teaching compete?). 

Highly specialized child psychologists and nutritionists supporting kids not getting enough at home. 

Flexible targets and multi-age classrooms with peer learning. Each child on their own pace going through rigorous but flexible criteria. (Why can't a kid be 9th grade English, 8th grade math, and 11th grade science if that's just how they're developing??).

https://charliemarketplace.substack.com/

step (3) is to get a sufficient understanding of the underlying technology. Ethereum being the most obvious choice.

step (4) would be to research different DAOs, understand their goals as a community-run company, and see which ones align to your goals (finance, healthcare, supply chain, entertainment, charity, etc.) and join their discord/telegram and *experience* a DAO. 

From there, jumping into PM should be do-able with enough experience actually having managed people/products in software or adjacent spaces.

People naturally improve what they own. An office admin won't automate their job with python if it puts them at risk of losing their job.

These concerns have limited Bitcoin adoption by institutions significantly. 
 
To some extent, people bought the narrative that Tesla, being so renewable focused, could opt into leading the charge on making bitcoin use renewable energy (which it does use a lot of renewable energy, but also a massive amount of coal especially in Chinese mining operations). For example, using excess solar capacity to mine Bitcoin and enabling Tesla vehicles themselves to passively mine it. But Tesla didn't seem interested in actually supporting the network via mining, it was just speculatively holding. 

That was always going to be a difficult thing to pull off in the short term. 

Ethereum, which is making a transition to proof of stake while carrying a $1T Decentralized finance ecosystem, is the logical choice for ESG focused institutions because a successful migration reduces energy expenditure by > 99.99%. 

I expect Tesla will buy Ethereum and I suspect that in a few years 100+ of the S&P500 will be holding Ethereum. 

I don't have any feelings about Musk or the Tesla brand. I'm not surprised people are calling him manipulative. His bitcoin sell off added the exact $100M needed to beat Q1 earning targets. He's a master of using free media and it shows. "

TopShots are NFTs on a centralized chain (NBA run blockchain built on Flowchain by Dapper Labs). They have complete control over the NFTs and the marketplace for the NFTs, including shutting down the market during package drop times to better manage congestion. 

Anything centralized can be taken away, just like how Big Tech can delete accounts or images or posts. 

NFTs in their current iteration struggle with resiliency. Many are on centralized exchanges like OpenSea or Rarible. Many are also structured poorly, using JSON metadata that points to an image hosted on a central server (e.g. by OpenSea, or an AWS S3, or another file storage platform). Because this metadata is on the blockchain, it's immutable. So link rot becomes a major concern. 

Probably $200-300M worth of NFTs will have link rot within the next 3-5 years. That's a conservative estimate. So the metadata on chain will be there, but the URL will go nowhere.

Alternatives include IPFS which incentivizes long term storage of digital information through a decentralized file hosting protocol, but even that is imperfect, as it relies on market participants continuing to host information.

The access model is important because for most things, most people wouldn't pay for it lol. But making it free (or disproportionately low cost) for all, subsidized by the power users, you generate network effects that improve the product overall.

This makes the culture of ownership much more concentrated. To own something, you have to really be invested in it, but it then becomes that much more meaningful.

I have Spotify premium but I still buy vinyls. I don't really own movies personally but plenty of people buy copies of movies & pay for streaming. 

I think with web 3.0, over the next 3-5 years we'll see an expansion of digitally native ownership and like you said, a new twist on how we define ownership (less about holding it in your hands and more about resellability, portability, etc.)
 
Ive never owned a basketball trading card, but I own an NBA TopShot. I have Chris Paul's '21 All Star Game dunk off a pass from Steph Curry.

So you *can* provide liquidity at different prices knowing that you'll only actually risk automatic trading at the prices specified; ergo - you can put ETH at $3-4k and Random coin at $10-20 (even if current price is $5) and you'll automatically accumulate ETH when the random coin crosses $10 (as people buy it from you as its price grows). 

I don't think it will affect gas prices honestly; to me its an entirely different mechanism. What I expect* is that ETH prices will skyrocket as PoS transition occurs and because people are in reality price sensitive to gas based on its $$ equivalent, we'll see decreasing gas prices in ETH terms but increasing in $$ terms until PoS and EIP-1559 launch. 

The fees already hurt a *lot* right now, and it's driving users to unsecure protocols and centralized platforms where high risk opportunities can be done with minimal transaction fees.

You'd be wrong haha. 

There's a ton of fighting in monetary policy circles over introducing a 0.1% transaction tax on the stock market- this fee is 3x that and it is completely accepted by the deFi market. 

The thing to get here is that the 0.3% isn't in US dollars (unless of course one of the liquidity pairs is coincidentally USDC, USDT, or similar stablecoin). It's a 0.3% fee on whatever you are selling to the AMM. 

I have 100 MSFT and I want 10 AMZN? The AMM will take my 99.7 MSFT and give me me 9.97 AMZN back. 

That 0.3 MSFT is split between all the liquidity providers. So I am *constantly accumulating more stock just by providing liquidity between the stocks*. 

Traditional finance doesn't do that! They pay in $$$s not in stock. Because $$$s is known to be inflationary.

It's a complex issue, but at a foundational level: healthcare is price inelastic (nobody shops for heart surgeons during a heart attack), inflationary (nobody can afford the inefficiencies), and embedding it with employment is the worst possible setup because it distorts the income spending of young, healthy people who need to be investing directly into assets - not expenses- while reducing important labor turnover including, yes, labor leaving the labor force which would put upward pressure on wages. 

The only real argument is: are we sure the government can make it more efficient than it currently is?

It adds friction to the labor market because people who don't actually want to be doing their job can't afford to switch and lose healthcare coverage for even a small period of time (don't bring up COBRA, I doubt you've even tried it LOL). So instead they just do barely enough to not get fired to keep their healthcare.

It also keeps people who would otherwise be retirement ready in terms of $$s sacked away in the labor force for heavily subsidized healthcare from younger employees. 

The current system also fails to incentivize efficiency because there is 0 information flow. 

They've done the studies: call 100 hospitals and try to get a price for an elective surgery. 

Good luck, it's a mess.

Hospitals will agree to take losses on hearts from Aetna but make up for it in big profit on kidneys from them.

But in terms of centralization. 

NFTs have 2 primary components: the metadata and the object. 

The storage of the object *rarely* happens directly on the blockchain because blocks have limited memory size (on purpose) and taking up a whole block with a single transaction is prohibitively expensive. 

So something that is done *poorly* right now, is open internet facing JPEG file hosted on AWS S3 or similar that is linked to the on-chain metadata, but that link isn't stable (i.e. link rot). 

The way around this is to utilize redundant, decentralized file storage systems- the most famous being IPFS. https://ipfs.io/#why 

But there are issues there too in terms of incentivizing nodes to maintain files long term. 

That's why the most common NFT structure is centralized exchange (e.g. OpenSea) that handles the metadata and sales and file storage all in one go. But you then have to trust their storage (or provide your own alternative)."

(2) Some people don't want to sell their stuff for cash, they want to keep their stuff and just borrow against it to get cash. 

If someone owns their home, and wants to keep living in it, but needs cash, they can take a loan against their house for the cash. The house is the collateral, and often the home value is much larger than the amount of cash they are borrowing. This is an overcollateralized loan.

If you want to create a diverse, inclusive workplace that includes whole people taking ownership both over products and how they engage with others- that's a lot of work, and it involves self-criticism and correction for past wrongs. If companies don't want to do that work and instead want to say slogans and make miniscule donations while never actually committing to long term investigation and action- that's probably more harmful to people who were tricked into joining a company than to just point blank say: ""we don't care about any of that stuff, but if you want to work for money you'll get X"". 

Again, personally, I think the market will value companies and products created by diverse, whole, authentic employees who can manage through conflict to improve their workplace cultures. 

But, if a company wants to opt out and just pay a premium to keep people quiet and focused on the work- all power to them. At least people will get paid, instead of paying for nothing (the too often, status quo). "

I think raising the capital gains tax in an unsustainably low interest rate environment is just a roundabout way of increasing the cost of money. If we believe money is too cheap (I think it is, look at the housing market right now lol) then making it more expensive makes sense. But why do it on the backend with taxes? Just do it at the front end with interest rates.

You would actually think at 2% rates we'd do more deficit spending on investment and then raise taxes marginally and gradually as rates rise to cool down the economy and build up surpluses to continue infrastructure investment once the market is cool."
2021-04-23 14:35:20,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6791308155813933056,"Just to continue my point. If the capital gains tax funds renewable energy re-education, infrastructure, childcare subsidies, and healthcare investment. Then it's entirely possible that a broad raising of the floor improves the economy overall relative to keeping the money in private markets where we kind of know the rich get richer lol. 

But if it's spent on irrelevant things or things that only serve a very specific niche of the economy (e.g. rural 5G, which just numerically doesn't impact that many people or businesses) then we might find it was a bad investment.

Realistically, where will the capital go? The stock market is at all time highs, we're in an everything bubble. The classic way to cool things down sustainably is to raise interest rates. 

I would actually support raising interest rates moreso than raising capital gains tax. But in some economist points of view, they are functionally similar in cooling down asset bubbles and incentivizing money to stay put for longer.

Improving water infrastructure reduces healthcare expenditures down the line. Some stuff pays for itself, most doesn't. It's always about where is this money going, will it be spent efficiently, will it generate returns. 

The vast majority of conversation about this stuff is just a proxy. If you believe taxes are bad, then you bring your answer to the question. If you think social services are good, you bring your answer to the question. Nobody is really considering the budget constraint & market context. 

A massive change in taxes is highly distortionary, regardless of direction. It's not a simple as down good or up good. 

My opinions are: 

(1) we're generating a lot of tax revenue, over 1 million million a year. If we have ideas on how to spend it better we need to live within the budget constraint and shift money around. It can't all be new money. 

(2) some activities are actually harmful and taxes are a good way of regulating that (e.g. renewable energy vs polluting energy). Others pay for themselves, at 2% interest, deficit spending might make sense, but does that mean we should let markets get addicted to cheap money? That has problems too. 

(3) the worst thing you can do, is constantly change the rules. If it's going to be 40%, fine, but can we keep it for 20 years instead of 2? Of it's going to be 20%, fine, but can we keep it for 20 years instead of 2?

The market assumes it's a burned wallet on purpose (i.e. those funds are lost)

Wallet distributions are not enough of an analysis to call a scam. We'd need to know if those insane wallets are live or not. If they are live, then yes, that points to network collusion risk, but if they are burned wallets from the earliest days of DOGE and the funds have never moved, then we should consider them permanent reductions in supply. 

Having said this, DOGE definitely makes crypto look bad lol. I personally hate what it's doing and I think investing as entertainment is a dangerous paradigm. 

I'll add one last note tho: these networks aren't static. It's entirely possible that the markets obsession with DOGE might actually drive developers to the network and that DOGE could improve to deserve its place in the market.

1) max all tax advantaged accounts 
2) HSA, FSA, disability insurance, life insurance
3) post tax IRA
4) mess around play money

The market has shown sweatshop labor has reduced both quality and cost, which consumers (now globally) are willing to accept. 

We need to remember that scale is extremely difficult. To scale products you need cheap, replaceable parts and a modular design amenable to complex global supply chains. 

 It is entirely possible that in the 1950s the top 10% of the global wealth (adjusted for PPP & inflation) was disproportionately USA. 

WW2, Marshall Plan, 200+ years of colonialism. No surprise the hegemony had a high floor for relative quality of life (among those of the majority group). You could walk into a job paying the equivalent of $18/hr today with minimal education back then.  

With more global competition, USA citizens have fallen out of the top global income (adjusted for PPP). There's tons of countries with massive amounts of rich people now.

This had a tremendous impact on equalizing wealth globally. The amount of people living on <$1/day as plummeted as jobs have transferred to other continents.

It also had a tremendous effect on reducing the costs of good, which does help consumers, but the economic literature has generally found that this cost reduction, when adjusted for significant quality reduction, has had a net negative effect on americans.

(2) the internet 

Colleges have to run an entire IT organization on top of the traditional teacher+books+seats model. This has driven massive expenses on non-teaching staff raising college costs (they're not profiting off these insane costs) 

(3) NAFTA

(1) but like more and I the 90s. 

When you complain (rightfully) that US wages have not kept up with productivity. The economics is that, with globalization, wages were actually over productivity before, and now wages are equalizing to global productivity. 

It sucks tho 🤣"

Billy loves baseball. He plays baseball video games and trades baseball cards.

Sally loves sports, but not video games. Both are in a baseball trading card FB group, but only billy is in the baseball video game group.

Using network analysis you can map individuals across some subset of FB groups.

Using community detection models you can even ""re""-group people based on their connections to each other and interests.

This can lead to interesting phenomenon like Billy and Sally both being in the ""baseball"" community. Or maybe they're both in the ""cards"" community. Maybe most obviously, they should both be in the ""sports"" community.

In reality, they are in multiple types of communities which are themselves subsets and partial overlaps of other communities.

Ordering these subsets is actually an incredibly hard & computationally expensive process. What hierarchical community detection does, is actually bucket groups in layers.

Is it more ""organized"" to have the baseball cards group fall under ""sports"" first, or under ""cards"" first. 

This has major implications for non-personalized targeted advertising, but I am looking into it for public health & disease model purposes."

The idea being that the population at large can opt into (and out of) the community and propose new ideas (i.e. products) and vote on them. Proposals that receive enough votes are put on the technology roadmap. Generally you buy/sell votes via the DAO's governance token which uses the free market to price control/ownership of the DAO (like a stock). Developers (and the Core team) are typically funded via a centralized group (venture capital) that forms the DAO and have a disproportionate amount of tokens, but best practice is to have a large vest period (5+ years) so that they success = multimillionaire for them + early investors and failure = a lot of time lost LOL. I'm a member of PieDAO and important disclosure is I'm heavily invested in their products and community -  discussing economics of the products, recommending product tweaks, etc.

Relatedly, a successful DAO is one where the governance token is spread out among the broader community. The founders start with 100% of the tokens, but by locking tokens and also using the tokens in marketing (imagine Facebook gave facebook stock to the first 1,000 users and more for each friend they invite), that % drops"

Whether it be the government, allowing motor vehicle departments to  run oracles on the blockchain for authenticating wallets via drivers licenses, or Facebook with their current ID process, or fiat on ramps (e.g. coinbase) that are obligated under know your customer laws to identify users of their centralized services. 

We often intermix Blockchain use cases to our detriment. 

Trustless, multi-agent, automatically governed transactions is the most common use case. Smart contracts and immutable record keeping being core to that use case.

In terms of NFTs, the benefit is portable, digital scarcity, using smart contracts and immutable record keeping, but automatically governed transactions is less relevant. We should expect to see a lot of industrial NFT usage to be explicitly not decentralized (e.g. NBA TopShot)."

Use free markets whenever possible, but put boundaries around markets that deal in goods beyond a certain inelasticity threshold (where free markets meet survival constraints and tend to be exploitative) including certain caps on capital concentration (i.e. taxing capital to fund baseline programs).

Virtually every economy in the world is one of 3 forms: market socialism, state capitalism, fascism.

State capitalism is an inversion of market socialism. Use free markets whenever possible, but put boundaries around markets to sustain capital development (i.e. tax labor to fund critical capital creation). It is unstable because by design laborers outnumber capitalists which leads to political turmoil and demand to move to market socialism."

People tend to get capitalism confused with ""free markets"". Free markets just means that products and services are priced based on the individual actions of economic actors. That, in general, information will flow and convergence happens. 

You can have free markets without capitalism. You can have capitalism without free markets.

Capitalism without free markets is generally labeled fascism. Free markets without capitalism doesn't have a general label because you can organize it in multiple ways. 

Communism can have free markets, but will typically use the state to allocate / control capital.

This system is unstable because it combines the worst of fascism (no free market for capital) with the worst of capitalism (state control of labor). It is the best connected/most powerful who become rich as opposed to the standard inversion of the rich becoming the best connected/most powerful.

If we haven't figured out communicating (let alone co-existing) with known intelligent life: dolphins, whales, octopus, apes, birds. 

Why should we expect alien life to be smarter than any of those very varied animals. 

And based on how we treat those animals and our own planet, why would they respect us?"

Heart disease is the #1 killer, 600,000+/year. Can an economy that allows healthier home cooked meals and more labor flexibility reduce this?

 If this $2T (very expensive 👀👀) infrastructure bill works and we get widespread broadband internet & 5G robotics etc. How many dangerous jobs can we have robots (controlled by people remotely) do? 

If we *know and expect* large changes in our labor force participation rate (currently plummeting for women and decreasing somewhat for older men) what are we doing to prepare? 

Can we nationally accredit certain MOOCs? Can we pull a germany and launch widespread apprenticeship programs as college alternatives? 

Can we reconfigure the 20% of our economy devoted to health go be more human centered and productive? We can shift people to home health, work on improving nursing home quality, improve evidence based medicine. 

I always look to health as an area of potential growth in employment. Until we solve death & disease there's always going to be a need and opportunity to invest in health.

There are so many already successful business models. If the goal is to make money, most often we don't need to reinvent the wheel. They could've put that same capital into local businesses or stocks and been way ahead.

But if you are actually trying to do something new, (especially tech oriented) then of course, trying & failing is going to teach you a lot.

There's an argument to be made that with reductions in SALT deductions and raising of the standard deduction that real estate is more easily invested in via REITs, but there's literally no investment that is: 

1) as culturally and regulatory protected 
2) as easily leveraged 

As direct real estate. 

I can get a 400k loan for a house on 20x leverage, but there's 0% chance I can get 20x leverage on an REIT and be paid 20x dividends LOL. 

My personal opinion is real estate is probably overly risky for most people who don't have the time to dedicate to it, and also, I think there are modern investment methods that CAN get you 20x leverage on some positions (but you risk regular liquidation)."

- drive community in all facets. 

Regularly pooled/subsidized catering, events, speakers, etc. All operated by professional community organizers who drive cross-pollination of startups/companies within an office. 

- flash renting

Get insanely nice conference rooms with the best AR/VR, airstream, etc. Someone should be able to walk in and share screen/audio on gigabit internet within seconds with minimal friction. 

1-3 days at a time. I can imagine semi-virtual conferences where the speakers and organizers are together to simplify ops but broadcast across all major platforms (twitch, YT, etc.) with 1-click WeWork tools. 

- pooled hiring

WeWork can run initial interviewing of talent for companies that opt-in to bypassing part of their interview process for WeWork selected candidates. Including pooling costs for technical assessments like livecode. 

- support startups with best practices in scale including finance e.g. Blockchain enabled ownership models (e.g. DAOs).

The value add for WeWork is NOT partitioned real estate. That would be the lowest value case.

The value add should be highly technical community organizers with relationships to resources that help members grow."

A business analyst might do more ""limited"" work like: mostly Excel, minor SQL, minor R. But they'll generally be a product person. 

While a DA/DS is going to cover advanced excel, SQL, R, Python, some cloud. But rarely be a product person too. 

I think the distinction between DE & DS is much larger than DS & DA. 

And too often DAs are confused with BAs which is a *purposefully* tech limited role because it is product biased.

So, if we confuse DAs as BAs, yeah this gulf will feel big. But when we recognize that it's really a spectrum of: 

Product oriented <-- --> implementation oriented 

It's pretty quick to recognize who is closer to what on this spectrum and who is surprisingly close together."

+ Enables standardization of digital items across compliant platforms (e.g. in video games, items bought in one game can transfer to another this makes huge synergy opportunities across multi-billion dollar entertainment products).

- Typically *not* created and managed correctly due to lack of knowledge by the average enterprise engaging in NFTs. Many NFTs use centralized file storage to store the digital object itself and/or its metadata. This can lead to link rot, which would essentially destroy the value of the NFT. NFTs need to be stored within the blockchain and be purposefully duplicated (i.e. IPFS is not enough). 

- Anyone can NFT anything, so NFT-ing copyrighted material has no intrinsic mechanisms for a centralized group (i.e. the government) to enforce copyright.

- value is completely market determined."

I think it's obvious that there's marketing value for them, but something detailed really well in the book When Coffee and Kale Compete is that the *who* matters.

A business executive paying $200,000 to get coaching from Jimmy McBusiness, versus paying $200,000 to get coaching from Mark Cuban, or Oprah, or Prince Harry - can completely change how the coaching is received. Even if the words are the exact same. 

So the idea that this is just some fru fru royal getting a cush do-nothing job to get some marketing going is probably not correct.

Sure, it's marketing, but if you actually look at their business model and ask - ""can he make noticeable contributions based on his experiences"" I don't see how anyone can say no."

I would imagine the cutting edge ones include natural language processing for generating recommendations based on the job description keywords. 

I built a tiny ATS that ranked by keywords for a company I was working at. It literally just stored resumes and sorted them by containing your keywords. 

It's very difficult for me to understand how a professional ATS wouldn't have candidate sorting using some kind of regular expressions search at a minimum.

I think it's entirely compatible for people to want to ""beat ATS"" in the context of being read by a recruiter at a good time (e.g. first thing in the morning, or on top of the results page).

I'm not saying you need to be on the cutting edge of everything.

You don't have to invest in every ""nExT fAcEbOoK"" you get pitched.

But you need to identify where you're not making business sense.

1) the vast majority of business decisions are directional.

Do we think X is profitable?

of course, the ""proper"" thing to do is assess opportunity costs and risk and all that. But typically, the choice avoided is just the status quo. Which you should understand really well having lived it.

For #datascience this means calling it when PCA, LR, RF, CART, KNN, LDA - the standard stuff - are JUST FINE.

2) the vast majority of business decisions are reversible.

Run your regression, test it on data it hasn't seen, interpret the results and try it out. 

obviously some decisions are massive and this doesn't work (e.g. in pharma) but retail? entertainment? consumer services? 

Agile has beaten waterfall for a reason.

3) If somebody else has already done it, you're not innovating.

I've heard stories from industry folk that ANY new idea they present must include case studies on how it's worked for competitors... 

You have to be willing to be 1st!"

I think ""focused on fancy technologies"" and a few similar phrases considered ""level 1"" are a bit of a misstatement. It's not fair to compare those choices (e.g. to be an IC) with not having humility.

We can't all be managers or people people.

Someone has to do the grind work, and that includes being experimental, trying new, uncertain, premature technologies in a way that is haphazard and possibly not tied to tangible (known) business value.

(Yes I said it, not everything profitable can be known or have it's ROI estimated ahead of time)

I know in data science say too many people are focused on insane neural networks and throwing math at problems that don't need it.

But isn't that a good problem to have? A wave of people who've overstudied something not *yet* used everyday?

Imagine a jr analyst who discovered Docker in 2013. 

No use case, corporations had barely recognized non reproducibility as a core strategic gap in their data science.

What's new is a digital-native generation facing structural impediments to normal social developments; e.g., the loss of funding for public spaces post 2008, creating a vicious feedback loop where: 

 Nobody uses public space because it isn't good --> 
 nobody uses public space anyway they have social media --> Why make public spaces better if everyone is just on their phone --> Why get off my phone, there isn't anywhere good to go anyway. 

I don't actually care about Walmart in particular lol. I acknowledge they have made massive negative impacts in small business in suburban, exurban, and rural places throughout the country (including rewarding auto-oriented development in many ways)- my point is that for Amazon to become a *place* is more difficult than Walmart becoming a *positive* place in a city's built environment. 

I don't hang at the 'Mart personally, and it's not currently designed to be a positive place, I acknowledge all that grey lol. But it will have an easier time than Amazon if it sees fit to become one."

If you believe in a technology and want to invest in it- the rational thing to do is make it a reasonable fraction of your overall investment portfolio and dollar cost average into it. 

If you're interested in the technologies behind NFTs but don't necessarily want to invest in a JPG- you can invest in the companies behind the technology. 

I talk about this more in my book that I don't want to shill too hard here - but needless to say, you can invest a reasonable proportion of your portfolio into cryptographic assets like: 

RARI - rarible's token 
ARTE - Items, a technology that does ERC-20 wrappers for NFTs

I think what's grey is how teenagers today: aren't driving, aren't getting high school jobs, aren't seeing friends unsupervised, aren't going out of their homes unsupervised, and effectively living their lives entirely on social media / internet. 

These are only worsened with covid, but the pattern has been years coming. The amount of 8th graders who said they had spent times with friends in public without parents has plummeted since the advent of the iPhone (correlation that I'd argue fits causation). 

Similarly, suicide rates for young girls ( 9 - 12 ) has skyrocketed in the same time period. 

As an urban economist, I'm hyperfocused on how we've lost ""third places"" for this demographic. We need libraries, malls, public parks, and yes- even Walmarts - to get people out of the home-work-home-repeat migration pattern. It's just not healthy for us to have so little variance in our environments.

Something I think about regularly is the inverse relationship between labor productivity and entrepreneurship. This makes sense, entrepreneurship has wages as the opportunity cost, and wages should be related to marginal productivity. But entrepreneurship (and small business in general) is critical for a diverse, resilient economy. 

What UBI does is let us get out of the minimum wage distraction conversation, separate healthcare from employment, stabilize consumption (smoother business cycles), and give more opportunities for entrepreneurship which I think will pay massive dividends in innovation, quality, pricing, and local resilience.

I look at is as a foundational piece of the economy, payment streams for natural resources is a natural funding mechanism for UBI and could be configured as part of a property tax schema to minimize distortion / dead weight loss."

Layer 2 solutions offer off-chain reconciliation of parts of the transaction network and lower frequency commitment to the chain while retaining the security of transactions.

I 100% understand what you're saying in terms of unsustainability, my point is that Bitcoin will not replace all financial transactions, it will plateau and be cannibalized by other coins with better efficiencies, and numerous other things will happen.

I don't think it's a pure disaster at all. 85% of all bitcoin is already mined; it could stop being mined entirely and still have value and still grow in value from natural erosion of wallets.

I just think this entire thing is super blown out of proportion. If we're worried about 3.5% of China's annual energy consumption, we have much better targets for energy reduction than bitcoin.

Again, you're free to do and believe whatever. But we either incentivize population growth and replacement or we completely reengineer the entire economic system. 

There's a reason governments and capitalists pick the former instead of the latter. Much easier.

All other arguments are a distraction. If you have a proposal on rebuilding the global economy to not be a growth required ponzi scheme, I'm all ears though! Lol

(1) diverse economy with minimal reliance on state funds. This is extremely difficult given the public necessity of energy, telecoms, defense, transportation, finance, healthcare, etc.

(2) robust independent monetary policy that is willing and able to slow down good times to build up funds for bad times. Extremely difficult knowing that not everyone makes it during good times and policy will leave them behind. These people at the margins are especially at risk during downturns, so them missing out on good times is also a sociopolitical stability concern.

(3) a healthy, educated, and age diverse population with strong social trust and good information flow. Population is elastic to interest rates and is not overly biased towards savings (hoarding) or spending (hyperconsumption) that makes business cycles worse. 

(4) a balance between short term monopoly rewards for innovation and a highly competitive private sector that ensures economic mobility and politically acceptable income inequality. Extremely difficult without (1) and (3), as high income inequality leads to social unrest which leads to uncertainty which can lead to defensive inflation (prices rise to spur capital owners savings, not costs)."

These calculators tend to assign probabilities based on your opponent having 2 random, but possible, cards, i.e. they have the same chance of having 2,7 as A,A when those cards aren't known to be exhausted on the board or in your hand.

You need an interface to input your expectations about their range of potential hands, and then the calculator can determine likelihood respective of the uniform distribution of hands you've determined to be possible for them to have. 

Limit holdem has been solved by adaptive AI that continuously updates the opponent hand likelihood from their historic betting patterns. But no-limit holdem is effectively infinitely more complex due to bet *size* being a continuous and inconsistent factor (i.e. people can have balanced sizing for bluffs and non bluffs).

I'm an economist telling you that the blockchain will differentiate the historical sales record of a non-fungible item and that I expect your derivative work will not be highly valued by the market given it doesn't have any tie back to the original item or creator.

If you try and force decentralized technology (NFTs) into a Centralized framework (government supported copyright law) you're going to miss the point.

Again, I already agree that art is not worth $1M *to me*. 

Getty might come after you for stealing their image and changing 1 pixel using the government's power to enforce copyright. 

In NFTs, the market will simply not value your derivative work unless it does, the historical record is available and immutable. Anyone will know when you made your derivative work and it'll be trivial to identify the original.

It's about having a legitimate marketplace where buyers in good faith can access content. There's a phrase- ""piracy is a service problem, not a pricing problem"".

Netflix killed pirate bay, not copyright laws. If you make something accessible and legitimate, the typical person will pay a fair price for it. 

NFTs offer the same mechanism for all creative content. Sure, you can download an image, but if you wanted to know who the real owner is- right click, image search, boom- there's a wrapped NFT detailing it's creation, owner, and history of sale. You can buy a ""legitimate"" copy through that service, which would give you access to a secondary market of other legitimacy seeking buyers in the future, or just steal a copy for your own use.

I think you'd benefit from a read of the governance sections of my book. I think you're misinterpreting how the blockchain enforces governance. Anyone can put anything on a blockchain, enforcement of rules is opt-in and algorithmic, but it's not a panacea."

If you don't like the private corporation examples, swap them out for any 2 government agencies like NOAA and NGA. There *should* be a market for combining spatial data and weather data - but it hasn't happened yet due to the easy ability to copy/paste data without any record of ownership.

Some argue it's oil, I used to agree but was convinced otherwise. Data requires a system. You could take all of Amazon's retail data (worth millions to them) and give it to Facebook and it be near worthless. 

Oil is generally good at multiple refineries. 

Maybe part of that Amazon data is usable by Facebook with enough integration work, but it's hard to argue they could turn it into the billions of dollars of value that Amazon generates with it. 

A decentralized, trustless, curated, generalized data marketplace would incentivize work to occur between these edge cases. A public dump of Amazon data is ""open source"" but it's not necessarily economic value. but a public dump + incentivized individuals that curate pieces of it for derivative use and profit from making datasets that can then be resold/tracked would be economic value.

It allows for trustless coordination of complex, possibly adversarial, multi-agent systems. 

For example, can Google and Microsoft anonymously share data with a marketplace (or with each other) without relying on a centralized intermediary like SafeGraph (a data company I really like) coordinating the agreements and enforcement of those agreements.

I don't cover NFTs in my book, but the same thinking holds. Trustless, complex, multi-agent, decentralized organization and transfer of information is game-changing.

Relatedly, other sites like webarchive will copy their content explicitly to make available and their content is used across the internet as cited source material, etc. 

News is a public good and we're treating it like a club good and if we want high quality news we need to fund it. a social media platform funding it is a harder sell than a search engine that takes their content as inputs into their product. There's a reason it resulted the way it did."

Google doesn't own the internet, so it's scraping news websites to make them searchable and mine them for summaries, e.g. its amp service. 

That's why Facebook refused to pay and Google couldn't refuse. 

People expect news from Google, plenty of people are just fine using Facebook for family and friends and not information. 

Although, personal opinion, I think this makes fake news significantly more risky for Facebook's brand. It's already fallen out with young people who prefer instagram (owned by FB but at risk of separation in an antitrust case) and tiktok.

Bitcoin mining is insanely expensive resource wise, it's arguably not expensive relative to the current alternatives (I mean, you have to grow a tree to cut it to make paper and then ship the paper which uses oil, the whole supply chain for analog recordkeeping is insane) but the conversation is becoming moot given new proof mechanisms.

I fully expect regular people will be buying into that in a few years (when it's up 10-20x  LOL). I'm writing a short book on blockchain / DeFI including some very high level strategies available for those looking to make returns in the new market with minimized risk.

If you don't think they have value, that's fine man. Diversify elsewhere. I buy stock, I buy bonds, I buy crypto, I buy real estate, I keep cash on hand. Diversification is good finance.

1) evolution of the ecosystem in terms of finance products
2) evolution of the ecosystem in secondary markets 
3) widespread growth in anti-centralization, whether it be finance, social media, news, or other. 

There's a demand for decentralization and I think blockchain is the only product that really makes it work. 

But even then, that didn't tip me over the edge. 

It was talking to clients, high up in numerous gov agencies who are asking if blockchain can solve their finance problems. Transferring literally Billions of dollars, every year, under conditions (i.e. smart contracts). 

Whether it be IBM or Oracle, there's something brewing with this technology at the enterprise level and I think now is the right time to be on the bottom floor.

This caused a ""death spiral"". Typically a death spiral, like Bear Stearns in 2008, is when you go to sell, there's no buyers, so you lower the price and try again. When people are all trying to do that at once, it's a race to the bottom. Once a stock drops too much too quickly, you get even fewer buyers interested. 

Because GME was so shorted, it's death spiral is to go *UP* in price. Also called a ""short squeeze"". Short positions get so scared of seeing losses >100% that they rush to buy out their position. But nobody is selling. So you get an upward death spiral.

The options are to wait it out and see 2-500% losses, or join the death spiral and make it all worse."

I know business-stats-R/Python-excel-SQL is a totally legitimate business need and one that will not be dropping anytime soon. 

But the kind of evidence I would expect that the *supply* is not meeting this demand would be: 

1) faster hiring cycles
2) higher wage growth
3) less applicants per role 
4) bootcamp/university graduates with multiple offers upon graduation
5) acceptance of cross-industry experience in hiring (as opposed to looking for in-industry exp specifically).

I see all of these for data engineering, and have yet to find any evidence it's true for data analytics.

I know NCSU publishes their MS analytics data and they have an average >2 offers per student upon graduation, but they cover a lot of data engineering in their program so I'm not shocked. 

You'd think bootcamps and universities would be shouting from the rooftops if their analytics masters and data scit bachelor's students were drowning in job offers?"

If you post a job saying ""good stats, some business experience, R or Python, and a little bit of SQL"". You'll have 200 applications within 2 days. And a massive amount of them will have degree and certificates with those skills. 

If we accept the premise that anyone who can effectively do the job or learn to do the job within 30ish days is ""qualified"". I'd say it's still a whittling down of 20-50 legit applicants. 

I feel like the supply is tremendously higher than demand and that wages will stagnate or fall soon.

I would feel differently if businesses *needed* more advanced stuff. But from what I'm hearing about the market, a lot of highly qualified data scientists are doing very foundational work that could have been trusted to someone with enough skill at a lower wage.

There's not enough advanced work to go around. And businesses selling themselves as ""AI"" can't admit that what they really need are Excel templates, a PowerApps workflow, SQL procs, and a few shiny apps. 

I think the dot-AI bubble is bigger than the Bitcoin bubble."

But I'm still not seeing the connection of how news would be paid for making their content available to the masses. If anything, you would think the natural relationship would be for the news to pay Google and Facebook to reach audiences. 

Which they do of course through advertisement, but not through search and news feed.

I think the broader issue here is that we have an advertising duopoly with an ad business too intimately tied to the native products (search and news feed respectively). 

I think the government's role would be to bust this duopoly, but realistically they can't. Because by design search and news feed don't have any revenue generating properties and *creating one* would be terrible for how people use the internet today.

If the search is simply driving people to sites and the people click the site, then it's up to the news media to price appropriately. 

The reality is that news is a public good. But we treat it as a club good. This misalignment means that good news is expensive and thus in low supply, while literal garbage fraud is cheap and in high supply. 

It is the *governments* role to support public goods but because of the sensitivity around media's role as the ""check on government"" and their historic issues with being beholden to owners, that has had limited success in terms of fair domestic news coverage. 

This is an issue going back literally *hundreds* of years. 

How do we determine truth, how do we pay for its summarization, how do we pay for its spread, and how do we reduce the spread of lies- which are in any sense of how they play out in groups of humans , a virus. 

The public vs club good misalignment is not going to be solved by having private organizations battle out who deserves a fraction of the search money and who doesn't. They'll pick the cheap fake news."

The argument looks kind of weak in the context of Disney's liabilities though. Massive workforce, weak globalization of content, theme parks, manufacturing commits, retail establishments, etc. 

Disney is excellent at squeezing every cent because it has to or it'll die. I mean, how many times can they re-make Lion King? LOL. Yes, toys, re-makes, broadway shows, etc. 

But let's focus on the question at hand. Disney will obviously dominate movie theatres, toys, memorabilia, live events, etc. That's it's entire thing. 

In terms of *streaming* specifically. In terms of Disney+ subscribers versus Netflix subscribers and hours spent on each platform. 

Disney will likely win in the US due to brand presence and then lose everywhere else due to lack of global content. So where 95% of the world lives, Disney will be losing.  

Of course, this may not *look* obvious if you allow for Disney to simply purchase global content providers; like it purchased 8M subscribers simply by buying Hotstar India.

News is partly a public good, in that more people being more informed pays dividends to society. But it's treated as a club good- you pay for access but your reading of the NYT doesn't mean I can't also read that same NYT. 

More people having less money means less potential subscriptions per person. I can't realistically subscribe to 15+ news sites, it's the same problem as streaming! I'm spending more than cable nowadays to have Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon. No way in $_+# I'm getting NBC, ABC, CBS, HBO, and a billion others. 

This means more ads are needed to subsidize the content. 

But it also means the ads have to be of lower quality goods (cheap ads) because people won't click on stuff they can't afford to buy. 

This is a vicious cycle of more cheap ads leading to more cheap ads (I mean, Google Internet Chum lol). 

To some extent the logical answer *is* to subsidize news, but then we get into a sticky situation of either the government choosing news outlets (propaganda risk #1) or the mega-rich choosing news outlets (propaganda risk #2- current state). 

another answer is to reduce income inequality and raise more peoples incomes so that they can afford to buy good news."

This is actually against the Google Terms of Service but is considered a necessary evil to drive traffic. 

Overall, I think the ad-based internet is a brilliant invention gone too far. Business cannot survive from getting their customers to buy *other companies stuff* in exchange for a few pennies. 

We've turned the entire internet into an affiliate marketing program. 

Relatedly, journalism that is *good* costs money to make, there's a reason the disinformation in the US is free, it's because people are paying billions of dollars to propagandize people and a paywall defeats the point. 

This is a much bigger issue than just search engine listings versus publishers. It's about how do we fund the work it takes to write the Truth, especially when Fake is not only cheaper to produce and more viral, but it's actively subsidized by moneyed interests.

It's a deflationary Hayekian currency. It's gold that can be sent digitally. It's value needs to plateau for it to be long term useful as a medium of exchange, it's value will be determined by the inflation and seignorage of other countries. It can argued that it's market long term is its penetration rate into financial markets (effectively becoming a bond, hedging against inflation/seignorage globally in the long term) + it's value as a remittance and financial transfer technology.

The idea that the coin should be worth $0 because it's ""IP packets"" is probably nonsense. The idea that it's value should be a few $100 at most because, like you said, it's currently at 40x the largest currency, is one that is very much worth considering.

My personal beliefs are that our global financial system is >$200T, and there are only 21M coins that will be made, so it's just a math problem of (200T * penetration rate) / 21M.

If you believe 1%, you are implying a 20-30% growth (726B -> 900B) over a yet to be defined time period for market correction (i.e. for it to no longer be underpriced).

The connection is that assets have two competitors: spending and other assets. 

Every dollar in bitcoin is a dollar not spent and probably mostly, a dollar not invested in the stock market (it's not like bonds or savings accounts are beating inflation right now). 

So the idea of penetration as a % and *when* you expect it to hit that %, is a function of your estimation of people's preferences, and less so a function of the supply of the coin or its price. 

My point is that the modern investor considering BTC should be focused on making an estimate for the penetration % and really not get distracted by the supply (because it's essentially infinitely divisible with satoshis + enough advancement in computers) and price."

Under all this pressure of cost, commutes, chaos, it's no wonder states with different priorities (e.g. TX with effectively no public transportation, no state income tax, car-first culture, minimal social safety net) have been fighting to pull tech away from CA, they have something real to offer. 

But if the question is whether Austin will become the next X. That is going to depend on more than just the ability of workers to have good internet and work a CA job in TX. 

It's going to depend on regulation that determines the ease of business, the bias between employee and employer protection, it's ability to infill vs expand, it's ability to dynamically connect multiple city level economies into a regional economy with a lot of creative destruction & knowledge spillover.

6) possibly get your former employer to invest in that startup after you leave. 

The non-compete laws in CA are boons for Economic development especially in tech. 

There's a reason Florida (I'd say the worst state for non compete law relative to its economic size, having lived there and left because of a poor economy) struggles to build up it's tech ecosystem.  It's pretty much satellite office in Miami/Tampa or the oddball startup. 

As for Boulder, Austin vs NYC, SF. Companies are going to have to chase talent and talent is getting overwhelmed in large cities: cost, crowding, commute, chaos. I think if CA had done a better job handling it's homelessness and affordability crises we'd see a lot less shift away from the state.

- mortgage before you trade. Just to force people to burn cash to un-mortgage. No discounts.

- early/mid game pay to get out of Jail immediately, it's a token amount of money and rolling doubles is the same chance as rolling a 7 but generally a worse position to be in (you don't want to travel the board without buying properties) 

- in late-game, stay in jail the maximum amount of time possible if all the land is already developed. 

- offer people complex deals including: 

   - 1 or 2 turn immunity / rent insurance included in a trade when they're near your developed land.

   - insurance on home destruction on land you trade them (if they ever have to sell a house you'll match the bank's payment of half it's cost). 

- offer to pay their next jail visit if they're 6-8 spaces away from go to jail (alert them they're 6-8 spaces from Go to Jail)

- trade people low value land in exchange for immunity / rent insurance on their most developed land, especially if you're 6-8; 13-15 away."

- Buy everything you land on 
- offer other players 2-5x what they paid for anything they land on as early as possible cash has no meaning and you can always mortgage. 
- once you have a set of 3, use 4 houses, not hotels. There are a limited number of houses in the game, lock out other players ASAP. Although this makes street repairs more expensive and reduces marginal revenue, the lock out effect is critical until you can bankrupt a player. 
- the best spaces are the spaces 6-8 squares after Jail, and Then 6-8 after Go.
- the worst spaces are those 6-8 squares after Go to Jail square
- don't be afraid to overtrade for your 2nd square of a set, especially if you're 6-8 squares away from what would be your 3rd of the set, people (rightly) hate giving people their 3rd, but underestimate the probability that you'll land on a spot 7 squares away."

The planet resources are limited and are replenished at at a rate either not in control by people (or in most instances frankly, actively harmed by people). I agree entirely with this. 

Technological growth (labor multipliers) would include increasingly efficient uses of natural resources. (Or in any case, more efficient extraction methods).

But we aren't creating more land or water or oil or similar, so Economic growth isn't going to be a function of creating resources, it's just going to be a function of extracting and using them which is generally considered part of labor multipliers.

I think we both agree on the fundamentals though, our growth required capitalism is not sustainable and we either need to change the planet (find a new one to exploit), or learn to live within the planets means (sustainable economics)."

Although I do wish I picked up programming sooner lol. 

The *only* reason people are getting these degrees *at these insane prices* is because they have a monopoly on certifying competence.

It's actually a bit lazy. Employers don't want to have to develop their own robust, merit-based, non-biased competence assessments so they just pick a ""target school"" and ask for a small set of degrees (as if a sociology degree is any different than an economics degree...

So while I agree and think 35k for MBA+5yrs is ridiculous, I think it's a trap of lower cost of living cities, they don't differentiate on skills well, every job pays lower regardless of talent. 

It's why everybody goes to the big places to larger $$s in revenue (and costs) and save the inflated difference. 

If you want a dynamic city that people want to live in, you have to have differentiated industries that are competing for talent with cross-industry skills and reward higher levels of skill and education."

The summary version is: 

Pay is somewhat market based, in that HR pays money to a company that recommends pay bands based on location and skills. 

Pay is often representative of their estimate of your likelihood to succeed in the role + negotiation skills. 

Frankly, outside of the top 5-10 cities for tech (SF, NYC, Austin, Seattle, Boston, Atlanta...) the market for roles is trash. 

Pay is bad, opportunities are rare, there's like 1 industry in the whole city.

Deep research on Adversarial Networks & Adversarial AI

Example: Can you trick a satellite imagery based AI model into incorrectly tagging illegal Nuclear refinement facilities as hospitals by painting a big H on the roof? 

How would you attack an AI system to understand the loss function used in its training? If you identify the loss function used in training can you attack it with generated noise?

Advanced Biomedical use cases (think AlphaFold but for non-proteins, e.g. identifying potential antibiotics that do not incentivize resistance,  computational chemistry). 

Leveraging blockchain for reduction in fraud, waste, and abuse of multi-billion dollar funds transfers and improved auditing. 

Generation of Level 5 secure cloud infrastructure to allow off-prem storage of highly classified data.

(1)  is increased packaging of AI products with products people are used to seeing. 

NLP to finish sentences within a word document. 

AutoML on set tables in Excel.

Better search functionally (including semantic search) for windows file explorer. 

(2) is more off the shelf AI platform offerings.   DataRobot, Databricks, AWS Sagemaker, etc will be easier for firms to price because they'll align to specific types of customer profiles, and we'll see better segmentation and packaging of these products. 

You could imagine in terms of AWS getting Infrastructure as Code bundles that let you: 

Spin up a pre-sized EC2, preconnected to an S3 bucket with industry specific templated column names (put customer ID here, put price here, put date here), with a GUI for setting up Lambda functions and AWS email notifications.

This is a legitimate issue, and some of the best scientists in the world, including the now well known Black scientist, Kizzmekia ""Kizzy"" Corbett who was on the Covid-19 vaccine team for Moderna and who was interviewed in this link discussing how scientists need to do more to rebuild trust in their relationship to the black community. 

Her interview was not only enlightening but also comforting, as someone with Afro-Puerto Rican
 family who have similar distrusts in these systems. 

https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/16/health/kizzmekia-kizzy-corbett-interview-moderna-vaccine-gupta/index.html

I think you are right to be hesitant to trust products made by systems that have consistently shown both an inability and unwillingness to respect and understand black and brown bodies in critical ways. 

But I would urge you to look into why this vaccine in particular is incredibly good at it's risk to reward ratio, especially for black and brown people. 

- mRNA is a very new vaccination technology and builds off decades of understanding in HIV, and SARS (2003). 

- the vaccine shows incredible effectiveness in some of the largest clinical trials *ever* done."

AI, Data and Cloud are intimately linked. (MLOps / AiOps, DevOps)

Successful data science (the kind that makes good outcomes for customers): 

- has control over the data used and the environment where that data is analyzed and modeled (buzzwords: Cloud, Version Control, Infrastructure as Code, Data Version Control, CI/CD, APIs, etc.) 

- has self service in both provisioning of infrastructure (can you get a custom VM without anything more than a ticket to IT? Is that ticket automatically approved if it passes certain tests?) and using production models (can a salesperson interested in a specific type of client both filter available data to that client and also apply production models to that just that subset?) 

- has security and controls (""AAA"", role based controls, etc.) 

AI that misses on Data and Cloud is in my experience a primary reason that data science doesn't end up affecting (positively or negatively!) Customer experiences.

The idea being that by increasing the visibility of successful datasets you essentially create that Pareto 20% of datasets that get you 80% of value, and more resources can be spent ensuring that those primary, high impact, regular use datasets are clean, interpretable, and friendly at all level of users. 

To do that you need successful enterprise knowledge management (the ability to understand nuances of local domains quickly) and developer knowledge management (the ability to understand nuances of past artifacts quickly).


My non-committal belief is that plenty of people can look at data and generate insights, even if the vast majority can't appropriately create, shape, and manage data. This is where you want that fundamental divide in the engineering of data and the analytics of it."

The idea being that if the models are documented well enough that any end user can, for example, run a (pre parameterized) random forest algorithm on their data pull and get curated results (e.g. a pop up infographic would have boiler plate explanation for how relative importance is captured by the trees) and how to interpret coefficients. 

This is really just 1 step up from Excel -> OLS -> infobox detailing how to interpret slope coefficient 

I'm not sure where I fall on the spectrum of this versus ""no analysis by anyone not named an analyst"". 

Realistically, everyone performs analysis and leverages AI everyday constantly without thinking about it (Google search is just an AI librarian after all). 

So it's hard to be a gatekeeper here to be honest. And I don't do internal data science, so I'm probably not the right person to recommend anything on this topic."

1) nested headers 

Just don't do this. You end up having to read it all as characters, then attach the nest as a prefix to the 1st row (the actual headers) and then replace them and then re-class the columns. It's just setting up a bad programming session for a developer.

2) merged cells
Not normally a big deal because it can just be duplicated across cells when it's unmerged but it often leads to 3. 

3) inconsistent templating
Adding columns, changing column names, changing the amount of cells merged, adding in blank rows to separate things visually, doing ad-hoc NAs (NA, N/A, n/a, -999, Not Applicable - I've seen all of these serve as NAs within a SINGLE Excel file once), hidden sheets, changing the order of sheets, changing the name of sheets. 

All of these things make actually *working with* Excel incredibly difficult because you've designed for anti-scaling. I just have to assume you're scared that following a template and being a team player with the analytics people would cut you out of a job 🤣. 

I've done plenty of R Shiny apps that read explicitly designed Excel templates and I spend probably 20-30% of my development time writing warnings for different template errors."

1) you are only hiring the best talent *of what's available* and this post shows you don't actively seek to cultivate diverse talent so of course they don't apply. 

2) you assume your hiring practice *are actually effective in discerning who can do the job best*. You would be a multi billion dollar recruiting company if you could master selecting the best candidate as opposed to the one that just makes the right (implicitly biased) person feel the right (implicitly biased) way. 

This is just basic hiring psychology. People have a natural affinity to like people who look like them. They're more inclined to mentor them, to start off positive with them, to give them the benefit of the doubt more. 

There's a phrase, ""women are hired for their performance, men are hired for their potential"". Bias is REAL. It has been STUDIED. It has CONSEQUENCES. 

Your *customers* are probably not exclusively men, so why would your product team be exclusively men?

You could literally present me with any product or service and if I can ask a few basic questions to ensure I understand it's purpose and usability, I can estimate a price I'd pay for it. 

Everytime I buy something from a store and they ask, ""do you want a warranty"", I immediately calculate: ""can I afford to buy a 2nd one of this without flinching? what is the risk I'll break it in a way that covered by the warranty?"" Depending on those answers my willingness to pay for a warranty is R / years of warranty * price of replacement. 

Do I want a 1 year warranty on a $300 electric lawnmower? I'd pay $15 for that if I estimated 5% chance I'd break it within a year.

The thing is mechanically, BTC floor is rising because it costs so much to mine it and there's no way to say it'll just culturally stop being mined prior to it's finish date of 2100. 

People are spending 5-8k / coin on professional operations to mine them, including setting up warehouses next to rivers in NE Washington State to keep their computers from overheating and leveraging low cost renewable energies to squeeze every drop of profit from mining a coin. 

Sure, it won't be one way to 40k+, I expect drops of 10%+ regularly and randomly. But ""crash"" implies Lehman Brothers (actual collapse) when I think JP Morgan is a better comparison (fell from 35 -> 15 in 2008. Is now > $100)."

It's like a date kind of. Whoever asks should pay. In recruiting whoever asks should disclose. 


I think it's a bit paradoxical to go out of your way to apply to a job and then upon interview be clueless on the price you desire. That kind of implies you didn't do research. 

Whereas if they ping you, of course you didn't do any research, and they should have done research on you meaning they should be assuming you're in their range and be able to estimate how much they'd like to pay for your services. 

It's about the internal consistency I guess. But nonetheless you should generally be able to appraise yourself to the market for your skills, that's just a fundamental business (even of size 1) thing to do."

 This graph is showing the predicted value y-hat versus its residual. So for some inputs [X1, X2] => f(X1) = yhat1 = f(X2) = yhat2  but the corresponding truth Y is actually the opposite. F(X1) = y1 != F(X2) = y2. 

This can be the case for logistic regression which Adrian pointed out. Where you have some probability of either 0 or 1, two sets of inputs can return 1 when modeled, while their true values are 1 and 0. 

This is how you would get the same predicted value (e.g. 0.5 from LR which needs a cutoff for binary classification) while the residuals be opposite for the same yhat."

Again, never assume people truly know their own preferences. 

I like 1 page things cause it's less reading- but I like 2 page things when I want to have extra information to assess something. 

Another bias that might be hidden here is the mere exposure effect. Simply holding something (or seeing someone) for a longer period of time makes you biased towards liking it more. 

Now- naturally the counterpoint here is ""Carlos- these people know they're in a study, they have all day to review these. It's not like they're at their job under a time constraint. When it counts they'll appreciate brevity"".

That is a great counterpoint- one that you should seriously consider. 

The answer isn't to ignore this evidence and assume the evidence-less position. The answer is to make sure that if you do write 2 pages, it is actually engaging, informative, and a good sales document.

Now that we have that number. We can pretty clearly and quickly say: $1200 per person to keep them safe during a pandemic was woefully inadequate. 

We could have subsidized wages directly, subsidized mortgages and rents, strategically closed down more strictly for shorter bursts, etc etc. 

Imagine if we went full shutdown every other week (subsidizing business costs in those weeks appropriately) in the early months of the pandemic.

New cases would have time to become symptomatic, improving the ability for people to self-regulate their exposure, making contact tracing easier.

I think the fact TFP AND GDP fail to reflect wikipedia's value is more a function of a metric failing to capture what it wasn't designed to capture. 

Wikipedia, stackoverflow, open source programming languages. They're driving entire industries like software development, data science, etc. When those industries are successful at *reducing waste* what we might expect to see from an economic measurement perspective is that firms actually do less discrete recorded purchases (e.g. paying a company to manage it's databases) and instead see that money spent on salaries (but only a fraction of it), new investments (again, some fraction of waste saved), and cash stored. 

Cash stored is *supposed* to be new investment elsewhere, such that it still counts in GDP somewhere, but unfortunately given the structural low interest rate environment we're seeing a pretty big breakdown of how the economy is measured.

(1) make education expensive so our efficiency drops long-term 

(2) saddle your young people with debt to reduce their family sizes.

Eventually, countries will wake up and realize brain drain + body drain is a doomsday for their economy too and we'll see governments compete to retain talent and inspire bigger families.

Do we really want to be competing with India (2.2) Nigeria (5.4), etc. on birth rates?

Once they lower emigration, either by law or by disincentivizing it through a stronger domestic economy, we'll be doomed!

If $50,000 in student loan forgiveness shifts families from 1 baby (remember: future worker!) to 2, or better yet 2->3, that's exponential differences in our population growth. That gives the pressure on our technological growth a MASSIVE AMOUNT of breathing room. 

Why would we play economics one-handed???"

The entire class (except me) drew caricatures. Black families, almost always overweight. 

I drew a Latino one, having grown up visiting the projects of Puerto Rico to stay with family in the summers, I was just drawing what I knew. 

Back then, as a kid, 6,8,9,11,13 years old, it wasn't weird to be sent to the store to buy cigarettes, beer, and lotto with welfare benefits. 

The psych teacher correctly assumed that we had these hidden biases around poverty and race, and shared with us that she (was white, midwestern heritage) had been on welfare and used food banks during 2 especially bad periods of her life for several months each stint. 

It blew the class's minds (our school was 90%+ white at the time) that a ""regular"" ""moral"" ""normal"" [these are codes for white presumably] person would ever rely on the social safety net. 

But I mean, that's what it's for right?

This does not validate the *lack* of support for individuals, but it makes it partially sensible that they would be given some sort of support given 90%+ drops in revenues.

The answers are: 

(1) it's novel but a lot of previous research in SARS has turned out to be useful. 

(2) the entire bureaucracy has prioritized this vaccine in a way no other public health crisis has ever been prioritized. We have government employees working 16 hour days to get the paperwork processes at maximum speed of approval while maintaining the highest safety standards. 

A bungled vaccine that doesn't work will cost TRILLIONS of more dollars than just getting it right the first time. It would be a collapse of the highest order, possibly unseen since the fall of the soviet union in terms of chaos and human life lost, if people en masse decided to let Covid-19 run its course through the population because they lost hope.

(3) unprecedented investment (both public and private) in not just money (Billions) terms but also people-time. These vaccine trials get literally 10s of 1000s of people willing to put themselves at risk to support it's development and really *good* candidates too.

But SAS has to my understanding completely handled backwards compatibility of its code. Code from 1980 will run today and apparently the same in 20 years for today.

If you have tabular data and set models with set parameters and you're just looking to schedule re-trains and deliver it's outputs, I could see SAS further developing its GUIs to the point where it becomes a popular no-code tool.

And let yourself feel whatever you're feeling. Something I learned in a metacognition course before I dropped my philosophy goals was that ideas and feelings happen *to* you. You don't choose them, they are *not* YOU. You are the awareness choosing which items from the menu of ideas and feelings you want to actualize with actions.

So if you're feeling overwhelmed and manic, just let yourself feel that but try not to commit any *actions* based on them. Just sit, they'll pass eventually. The vast majority of human feelings have roughly a 20-min cap on how long you can feel them in one sitting. 

Things like grief, depression, despair, etc. of course will have multiple 20-mins within a day, even within an hour, but realistically, thinking about how you're feeling prolongs the feeling.

Metacognitive thinking (thinking about thinking) can allow you to just accept the wave, be patient until it passes, and then go back to what you were trying to do. 

A lot of people make the mistake of internalizing feelings. That because they *feel* something they *are* something. That's just not what modern brain science tells us. It's when feelings become actions that they become ""me""."

- overproduction, which leads to waste including actual destruction of crops to keep prices stable (this is a real thing, we pay farmers to burn crops (strategically I should note) to stabilize prices and keep enough profits to keep the engine of innovation going.

- misplaced production, there's so much corn and they need to be used somehow because, I mean, who really *wants* to waste it just feels wrong. And then we get high fructose corn syrup and that gets put into every food imaginable and now we have an obesity and child diabetes epidemic.

- crowded out production, all that land used for corn that got burned and all that subsidy money wasn't spent on its next best use-case. The taxes that paid for that subsidy might have been the money someone was going to use to create a small business or go into farming themselves with a new idea that could have improved the whole industry. 

So now we have something like 2-1 or probably more like a 2-2 tie for the conservative vs liberal positions on this issue. 

No principle is *wrong* nobody is a *bad person* who wants to starve americans or kill the small farming industry. Its just tough decisions."

Looks like it's somewhat tied now, 1-1, or maybe 1-2 because the neoliberal system is what is currently in place today. 

Deregulation and free market for something like food won't produce enough to keep costs low and that has political risks (we can look at how rising bread prices was a major catalyst of the Arab Spring that saw major civil unrest in multiple countries). And the current (neo)liberal system of subsidizing production and food stamps seems to be leading to enough food production and use that people are not starving en masse in the streets (although we do still have ~10-15% of people as food insecure in the US). 

Ok well then keep going to principles. 

Conservative principle says that whatever is incentivized gets done. The bureaucracy layer of the (neo)liberal position requires explicit laws and regulation to decide what production gets subsidized. 

If all the farmers are making corn then we get unintended consequences. (Part 4)"

What takes a local farmer 2 acres to grow, a highly efficient mega-corporation may take just 0.1-0.5 acres. Plus, land is limited and there's lots of interesting side theories to google on how agricultural value of land serves as a limiting factor to city sizes and how there's history to understand in this argument.

That is to say, the best land for farming was probably absorbed by major cities historically and you can't farm where a building is. So there are limits to what the conservative principle can actually *output*. 

This efficiency of scale is critical for feeding a large population. So we get back to the conservative vs liberal principles. 

The conservative principle is that the price of goods should reflect whatever the market says. If food is expensive, well, it is what it is and people need to pay up, eat less, or eat worse. 

The liberal principle is that people have a right to some amount of food as mentioned above, but the bureaucracy layer is a major problem.

To reduce the bureaucracy layer, the government can instead of subsidizing food at the consumer level (food stamps) it can subsidize it at production. 

This is a kind of (neo)liberal compromise"

A person who carries a magic book that opens to the page with an answer of any question they have in their head immediately is indistinguishable from a person who memorizes the answer to all questions and takes a second to think about it. 

So the sooner we can accept that anything we can find on the internet within a few seconds is indistinguishable from what we have memorized, the sooner we can just stop memorizing things and instead memorize actions which actually accesses a much broader part of the brain.

Look at Uber, it took over a year for that stock to break it's IPO of $40 (it's at $47 now) after plummeting 50% in its first 6 months. 

Waiting for IPO is not what the rich do. So why is it the only hope the poor have? (and yep, clearly 93% of us are poor, because only 7% make 200k+ a year according to the census.)

It'd be one thing if I wasn't the kind of investor they wanted. Too little funds, no strategic benefit for the startup, etc. But to be *legally* not even allowed to ask if I can join a crowdsource is just flabbergasting."

When I think of corporate ""humaning"" in the marketing context I think of the highly unethical (in my opinion) blurring of corporate personhood in marketing.

Think: slimjim on instagram or Wendy's on twitter. 

Their social media teams actively engage in the platform as if they were individual people. 

SlimJim constantly comments on non-food related posts with child level jokes about 69/nice/420/eat-SlimJim (if you don't know what these mean, be happy, you're probably a mature adult 🤣). 

Wendy's put out a mixtape and actively engages in viral and meme phenomenon online. 

This Humaning is about increasing the perception of corporate personhood and in some ways it's a psychological attack. People don't understand that they're engaging with a massive marketing team hand-crafting this engagement and see themselves bonding with a brand the way they bond with other online friends (i.e. not IRL friends to use the internet speak).

The U-3 unemployment rate has a few issues: 

(1) if falls when people quit trying to find work (over 1M women left the work force in JUST September due to the pandemic and lack of support for children out of school) 

(2) it falls when people leave the workforce (250,000 americans have died, some fraction of which had jobs and are likely replaced now. This is NOT how you want unemployment to fall). 

(3) it falls when people become marginally employed: e.g. gig economy or part-time work unrelated to their field of study. 

The labor force participation rate is another relevant metric to track."

When the cloud is just ""a computer in virginia"" it's hard to see it's value over just doing data analytics and reporting locally. 

The value comes from: 

1) it's always available
2) complete isolated controls over access, authentication, and (oops forgot the 3rd A, there's a 3rd A in our paper LOL) 
3) decentralized development supporting alignment of development and production environments. 

The vast majority of companies don't need a bunch of elastic computing power running hundreds of terabytes of RAM in production in some fancy hybrid cloud structure. 

But they need to get past ""email me this week's Excel file and I'll run my old script on my laptop"". That works short term, but it doesn't scale and it's dependency mgmt hell. 

Its a paradox really. A wildly common problem I hear from clients is, ""we need to build something that persists after the person who built it leaves"" which is actually a huge pro-cloud argument, but they use it as a ""don't make anything too fancy, keep it in Excel"" argument. 

Combined with lack of capabilities in cloud, APIs, servers, databases, containerization, etc. It's a tough transition to make. 

This tech should be part of the data literacy movement."

Poll problems include: 

(1) arbitrary weighting schemas to force representativeness (this is extremely difficult to do well and is probably the primary source of polling errors)

(2) non representative sampling
People who answer the phone for random numbers might just be fundamentally different than people who do. They may systematically be distrustful of others and have a different split of ideologies. Can't really fix this lol. 

(3) Herding. Nobody wants to be the polling place who has Biden +35 in Texas. But good pollsters post their outliers because sometimes when you do sampling you just accidentally sample a non-representative group. 

(4) small sample sizes. 

My personal opinion is that polls need to double and maybe triple their sample sizes. Everytime I see a poll with 800 person samples I just feel dumbfounded. There are more than 10 types of people when you cross gender, age group, race/ethnicity, background, education, location, ideology etc. 

So in reality, your 800 person poll has at most 20-80 of each possible ""type"" of person (if we accept the premise that people can be bundled into ""types"") so the margins of error are probably WIDER than they report."

If you believe this, then stocks cannot be cheap or expensive, they are simply a single number assessment of how a company is forecasted to make dividend payments. Any deviation is just noise or arbitrage or market correction in progress.

Of course, in reality, we know that stocks signal more than that, they often act as an investor confidence index. Low confidence, switch to cash, otherwise put the money back in stocks.

To that end, we can use stocks as a proxy for people's confidence around uncertain events. Even if those confidences are ""accurate"" (e.g. world will collapse) they could be incorrectly calibrated (the world barely collapsed and will only be down for a few days). 

This gives 2 opportunities to make money. (1) off the people who are wrong and (2) off the people who are correct but exaggerated. 

So can stocks be ""cheap""? 

Yes, if the market is correct but exaggerated or if the market is just plain wrong than a stock can be priced under it's intrinsic value."

In the US, black people rarely have the ability to take pride in being Senagalese, or Ethiopian, or Kenyan, etc. Their culture and history and food was distorted through the diaspora. 

Black pride is pride in-spite-of not being able to better identify with a specific peoples or culture. And without a singular ""place"", e.g. how Puerto Ricans like me can claim the island, the only thing left to do is to take pride how your people have managed to survive and adjust to segregation and exploitation. 

""White"" pride doesn't make sense when you *do* get to know your more specific and more accurate culture and history of a peoples.

The second issue I see is ""American"" pride- which I have, in spite of the craziness sometimes I think the USA is on to something with this experiment of ours, is that people will use American pride to exclude people who were critical in building the USA: black people, chinese people, and immigrants and many other countries.

1,000,000 women leaving the workforce in 30 days is massive structural change, even if some fraction of them are happy because of various things like homeschooling/cooperative schooling is working well for their children. And that number isn't very subjective lol, it's a giant number with massive implications. 

I'm going to err on the side of just believing the women in the article and those in polls and other articles (not cited here but readily available on the internet) detailing the disproportionate impact women are having in this pandemic. 

If someone is dropping off their children during a pandemic (which my mom is doing with my youngest brother) it's probably because of being squeezed on multiple sides and doing some complicated personal calculus. Again, this is a very complex issue. The CDC notes that 100% of children who've died from Covid-19 were black or hispanic. So the calculus would even include things like racial health disparities.

I can go into a bunch more detail, but the thing to google is Malthusianism. The idea (was/is) that fixed renewable resources (e.g. how much the Earth can replenish per year) serve as a cap to human population and consumption. 

The truth is that historically we've managed to use technology to become ever more efficient in food production and consumption such that we've managed to have 7B+ people, the vast majority of which were born only in the last 100 or so years. 

The theory behind economic growth is that growth is fundamentally a function of: population growth and technological growth. 

(Picketty in Capital in the Twenty First Century details a similar parallel theory, that if the rate of return on capital exceeds these two growths as well, income inequality grows). 

Technological growth is a generally fuzzy word not strictly meaning computers, it just means efficiency gains through better use of resources including labor, good management would be a technology. 

We can have less people, but reducing our consumption reduces our income (my dollar spent is your dollar earned) and managing the resulting scale-down of the economy would be disastrous."

I WISH someone told me that it's all on google and I didn't have to do all that 🤣.

And honestly, any language is going to be easy or hard based on your previous experience with similar experiences. Pretty regularly I see people with certain Java/C backgrounds prefer Python and people with sas/stata backgrounds prefer R. 

Python is easy to read but dot notation can be confusing for people along with OOP. I know some VBA heads that do like Python for this reason. 

My brain is much for FP in which case R just fits easier for me. 

Both of my mentees are R users, 1 of them is doing engineering in undergrad and took Java and C courses (like my experience, those courses were essentially worthless in terms of long term applied learning) but much prefers R do to easier setup and better fit into how he thinks.

Considering they *had* to burn cash to make content if they wanted any chance at all to compete with netflix (~15B spent on *just content* not overhead in 2019) it isn't that crazy they spent it, it's crazy to me that they got it. 

You'd think they'd take some risks on content but then overload on investing in their top content (e.g. netflix model of dropping whole seasons). Also they had to spend on advertising but they did a bad job, I'd literally only ever seen 1-2 ads I think and I'm always online.

I wouldn't have invested in them just based on how little I knew about them, to be honest, I assumed they had like tens of millions of total funds raised and revenue based on how little I heard of them from anyone anywhere online or in person. 

I don't blame them for failing, but I think they made a pretty big tactical error in terms of brand awareness before burning it all on content or w/e else they spent it on. But maybe advertising a competing service is hard to do on YT/Hulu/cable TV."

They should have *known* this would be an issue and had thorough discussions with sociologists, ethicists, etc. and considered purposefully rebalancing the training data to reduce this issue. Frankly, it doesn't take much brains to do a few dozen tests and identify this problem. 

It's not okay that they allowed weight and color to be this prominently associated. Not because it's misrepresenting reality, it might represent our racist reality and history, but because it perpetuates certain ideas of beauty that cause harm and we should seek to reduce harms when possible.

Let's just switch the context to sales, 

""In the majority of cases, the buyer will get a cost reduction or value-add that greatly exceeds the commission the salesperson gets for helping them"". 

This is 100% true, everything I've ever sold was a value-add that exceeded the cost of 15mins to the buyer. But nonetheless, I still have to jump through a bazillion hoops to get them to agree to a demo, agree to get my emails, agree to talk to me, etc. Because they don't have awareness of my product, and I have to build that awareness for them to even fit it into their head. 

I mean, clearly your successful at your methods and do this full time, so I'm not trying to tell you what to do. 

But as someone who recruiters reach out to, the ones that give me everything upfront are the ones I am most willing to talk to because they've signaled, ""here's everything you need to know, but know that I have even more that you might want to know"" and then I get to talk to them as individual people without having to do the run-around on salary, etc."

My point in anti-algorithms is that I'd rather teach models based on use cases and how they work and what the results are and how to read particular outputs. 

As opposed to sitting down and learning the proof behind it, doing all the math by hand, performing matrix algebra by hand, etc. That's how I learned all my econometrics and it sucked and I really didn't learn much after the tests.

Start winding down on responsibilities, stop going the extra mile, and spend as much time as I can learning and practicing while maintaining the minimum output required to continue salary. 

In the US you can go from any bachelor's degree to a good salary business analyst within 3-6 months. It's not data science, but advanced Excel, a little bit of SQL, a medium amount of R, a few business books, and a few case studies relevant to an industry, and you can definitely contribute in some way somewhere.

For people refusing to learn to code, they can get by with just Excel but they'll need to dive deeper. But also, learning is a mindset, and it pays to learn to love learning. 

For USA the problem is you HAVE to have a degree, companies will completely ignore you otherwise. It's a trap 70%+ of Americans can't get out of. We need more affordable online bachelor's especially those you can test out of."

I would disagree. I think it's a big deal, it will be in the history books, it will cause trillions of dollars in damages and debt and lost productivity. 

""Should always"", as I mentioned elsewhere in this thread is my main point of contention. 

Even with civil war, the vast majority of those who died were men, so per capita is going to skew things. Someone could argue that per household is better for understanding the overall impact. 

He presented the argument that it's a big deal and provided raw count data as evidence. This whole thread seems to be nitpicking the metric, not the argument.

Your statement of X/Y is the *correct way* for *any* event is what I was referring to by my use of the word ""this"", when I said ""this is the strangest lie..."" 

Its a common misunderstanding in data interpretation that per capita is the *only* way to understand a phenomenon. The reality is it is one of several ways to understand a phenomenon. 

Including: 
Coefficients of inequity (how phenomenon affects different groups) 
Per capita
Per household 
Adjusted weightings (e.g. standardizing differences in state level demographics like age prior to reporting, or more common seasonal adjustment). 

Again you're coming at this looking to fight. Ian presented raw numbers, yes he chose which events to include and exclude but nonetheless the numbers as presented are generally considered to be correct in magnitude. 

You can interpret these as saying, ""this pandemic is on par with these events in terms of humans harmed"" or ""how humanity as a whole was harmed"" and there's a fruitful debate to be had in doing so.

Ecological fallacy
Modifiable area unit problem
Per capita fallacy 

Because it is entirely possible, that X/Z is even more useful than X/Y. 

It all depends on context and the decision making framework that you are in.

But people are insisting that anything that is not normalized is worthless and that is just a factually bad take. People are saying comparing raw numbers is ""dishonest"". No, it's just the numbers, it's the reality, it's the most compact form of information. 

Normalization is not a panacea. 

Example, it could be argued WWII deaths should not be considered per capita, because men were disproportionately sent to war. You could consider per household instead to better understand the loss. (comparing WWII to non-wars). 

Households change over time, so even that has issues. 

My point is not that posting a bunch of raw numbers is like some amazing thing that the OP did. My point is that the raw numbers are what they are. If you want to add nuance to the conversation through per capita, per household, per adult male, per labor force, or % change in GDP, or w/e. Go for it. Add nuance.

There are discernable differences between the major political parties in the USA and seeing this message feels like a slap in the face to all those who fought for the civil rights act and thus, the titles in that act related to fair voting. 

While a single vote may not do much and politicians are limited in their abilities to defy the corporations that are really running things, we know that politics works. Politicians enact laws (even if too many are just corporate copy/pastes) and change people's minds with their platforms. Look at what Bernie Sanders did to bring Medicare for All back into the mainstream after the failures to socialize medicine in the 90s. Even though he's just a senator, he's gotten millions of people interested in politics and activism. Even if you don't like his policies, he gets people interested in the game, and thus more willing to participate in society.

Voting should be the gateway to numerous other civic things people do. I'd really like the chance to convince you to vote if you'd be open to talking about it."

If the goal of a 1000 individuals is to make a specific package hit user targets, those 1000 individuals can make autonomous contributions that add to the whole goal. 

If the goal is some ephemeral thing like, ""make it the best at X feature, no make it the best at Y feature"", you get conflicts and in tech terms again, you get ""forks"". 

Forks are when people will copy/paste everything up to a certain point and agree to go separate directions after that. 

Companies need trusted, autonomous groups making local decisions that inch everyone toward the same goal. Add up all the inches, you get miles.
If you misalign departments, you can't be surprised when they decide to fork and pursue their goals separately. 

Which of course, is completely dysfunctional when company departments can't actually split off, you end up with ""outsourcing"" entire competencies. 

You can't outsource sales or marketing or IT. Those are core corporate competencies. The companies of the future will have: 

- everyone as a sales person
- everyone as a marketer 
- everyone as a techy.

What are the known issues with collection? How do you store what you collect? Is it 100s of xlsx, is it Access, is it S3? Is it structured? Is it on SQL Server? Is it relational? Is it graph?

It's irrational all around to privatize the cost of a social good. Everyone benefits when the population is more educated. 

And we know this is true because we have consistently funded and expanded socialized education for decades for children 4-18. Now experiments are showing benefits as early as 2 for socialized education.

The possibility of an event does not mean we should ignore averages and distributions that show significant risk and costs correlated with not going to college.

It would be tremendously (and maybe where we agree- arbitrarily) difficult to get numerous jobs out there without a degree. 

Does this mean degrees are the only way to get skilled and education? Of course not. This is blatantly true. 

But if a system has a bias towards people who got a university to stamp a piece of paper for them, then we'd be lying to put our heads in the sand and pretend the bias isn't relevant to life-planning. 

We should acknowledge it and actively dismantle degree bias and push for wider acceptance of alternative proof of skills while socializing some fraction of the burden for people experiencing the bias."

Wealth tests are ubiquitous in hiring. We get judged on our names (race/gender), education (nationality/wealth), etc all based on that 1 piece of paper which barely correlates to doing the job effectively. 

I'd like to see recruiting scaled down tremendously where jobs get <50 applicants because the job ads are actually written well, in depth, and correctly representative of the job.

(1) people need to take more responsibility in being a business of size 1 in selling themselves

 and 

(2) businesses need to have human centered design in their recruiting practices because how people apply to your jobs heavily impacts your brand recognition overall. 

Without conflicting. I agree that there shouldn't be complaining that you're getting interest, but I do think it's a fair criticism that people: 

 (1) apply to anything without really trying 

This is bad not only because it inundates companies, but also because it doesn't work and it's the path of least resistance. I can pump out 100 bad applications and collect unemployment and complain nobody is hiring and feel righteous anger about the system. 

(2) apply to things they aren't actually a good fit for. 

This just wastes time all around and at best is a result of desperation (if you ask me my personal opinion, I think we're rich enough as a country that we should separate basic survival from employment) and at worst is unemployment fraud. 

Again, see my personal opinion before anyone thinks I'm inhumane. I've been desperate on the job hunt before. It's terrible, anxiety ridden, stressful, and honestly cruel."

Hey Michael, 

I saw Tessellation was hiring. It's really cool that you went from DataRobot to a new firm and still actively sell it. I also love selling products that I know intimately. 

Whether it's Tableau, Alteryx, DataRobot, or custom micro-applications in R Shiny, I don't really care. For me, it's all about breaking down client problems into discrete steps and choosing the tools that get it done. 

Funny enough, your use cases on freight deadhead, warehousing, etc. fit perfectly with my freight brokerage experience. 

I think my DS skills + consulting/logistics background are a slam dunk. Are you looking to talk to people before they apply? I'm free 5-7pm your time zone throughout the week. 

Here's my phone #, resume (attached), and email. 

Does Wednesday work for you? If so, send me your email and I'll schedule the invite. 

Thanks!

In reality, people make the same mistakes on the job search: 

(1) They don't target roles ahead of time and build relationships before they need them. This causes them to apply to anything even lightly related to their goals, which leads to the *requirement* that they template everything, but templating everything also reduces your win % to near 0. 

Complete catch-22, but also completely avoidable. 

(2) They don't exploit (I mean this word positively) the human bias towards stories and narratives. They detail all the tasks they've ever done instead of telling 2-5 relevant stories that implicitly show they have the skills needed.

1) immediate feedback - this can be stressful because we mentally think the amount/speed of feedback is proportional to the difficulty of the problem. When in reality, a 5 hour problem and a 25 hour problem often have the same length of error code. 

2) lack of an expert - I often find entirely new bugs that aren't covered in documentation. I then have to break down each bug into its components to discover I actually have 1 (solveable) bug but it's return causes a bunch of derivative errors and those are the ones I see first. 

There's no expert just readily available to read your code and tell you the problem. School teaches us there's always an expert and the answer is readily available but being explicitly withheld from us to learn something. 

The reality of programming is, the answer is never withheld, possibly available, but rarely readily.

A completely different (and better) learning paradigm."

Being so broke that increasing prices for bread destroy your whole budget. You then can't even afford your token amounts of SPAM for variety anymore, so the only option is to commit to only eating bread and now you're buying more of something as the price goes up. 

The cause of many riots and revolutions. 

Alternatively, for luxury goods where price is a signal of quality/prestige, it is possible a price raise crosses a psychological threshold that leads to the good being more valued and increasing in sales. This is not as studied as poverty goods in the literature but its possible. "

Where inelastic means, the price must change drastically to change the demand for it (often governments even get involved in inelastic goods when they're essential to minimize predatory pricing). 


The answer is still it depends. Gasoline for example is highly inelastic, you can't put anything else in cars. 

But there is always substitution, for gasoline it's public transportation/walking/etc.

For food it's often lower quality food (e.g. SPAM). 

Often these goods with high substitution and low income effects are known as ""inferior"" goods."

1) I had coffee with current employees doing the work before I even applied, once in the morning before an interview. 

2) I've gone to meet the company's client after interviewing and before the offer stage.

3) I've requested a shadow hour to go watch the work being done and with what tools and by which person.

I've had multiple people message me that they turned down offers from my team to go work somewhere with a fancier job description and title, just to find out on day 1 the work has 0 relation to data. 

I've had others ask how they can infuse more data analytics into their work after 4 years of doing non-analytics.

I've heard others wonder how to figure out which job descriptions are overselling the job. 

The answer is the same: 

Trust, but verify. 

Unless you're the first data person (which I highly recommend not doing that), there will be someone on the team you can talk to. 

If you read a job description, do the interview, avoid asking questions b/c you want to be ""agreeable"", and then you pikachu face when the work doesn't fit into your goals... That's on you. 

Take some responsibility on pushing and asking for evidence that the role fits your goals. You're a business!"

It's like saying you can use a drill to put in a nail to hang a picture instead of a hammer and nail. Sure, but I'd actually be better off without a drill or a nail if I could just hang the picture using a command strip. 

What we need is for states to invest in universities, for universities to stop being football programs that teach on the side, and to scale up the best universities using technology. 

Why should only people who can afford Harvard get  a Harvard education. We should be recording and scaling those lessons and providing state sponsored support groups to copy/paste/edit those lessons to local audiences.

It's also the schools fault for pushing costs onto students when for the vast majority of their history they pushed costs to the state and local governments (good schools drive good taxpaying corporations to set up nearby, it's an *investment* not a cost...) 


Sure, are there cheaper schools, yeah, but remember that when you give advice, that advice needs to work for everyone to be useful. If everyone went to the cheap community colleges and took tests to waive courses, the universities would go bankrupt (like they already are). The universities are actively commiting fraud (look up law employment reports on this, schools will hire their own graduates for temp jobs to inflate their post graduate employment numbers). 

I get why someone would say, ""she signed the papers"", but come on, it's a coercion, if everyone suddenly woke up to the system's lies the system would collapse and you don't want that either.

You have production models and algorithms working off engagement with the feed; you add a new feature and suddenly the fundamental data generation process (FDGP) has changed and those models need to be updated. 

Then you have new production models in their infancy working on the new feature (e.g. reels). 

Outdated Model + Infant Model = REAL problems with understanding how your users are navigating changes.

I came for cherry, you mixed in blueberry, why??

Facebook messenger was great to replace texts but now I don't use the wall feature. 

Stories are great for sharing temporary things but now nothing passes the bar for being ""permanent"" on the grid. 

Reels are great for micro-videos, but now none of my little videos are worthy of being ""content"" so I just leave them on my story. 

Every feature: 

*Adds new users* 
*Moves current users*. 

In economics this is called the income and substitution effects in action. 

When a feature adds new users that's good, but if it moves too many users, that can fill a previous feature. The lack of economists in product teams leads to this kind of disaster. 

Because new features move people off old features, the algorithm trained on old feature interactions become worse and the algorithms for the new feature need lots of time to get new data. 

Combine an outdated algorithm with an infant one and you get the exact problem you're describing."

Fundamentally, ads only make money if they drive sales (or brand awareness which ultimately leads to sales, etc.) And monopolies are extremely hard to do given low fixed cost of entry for internet businesses. 

We have a structural time bomb in that young people are not getting enough money in enough frequency to drive the economy. 

We know this is true using money velocity as a metric. The people who have money are parking it at rates we've never see before. Until we can get corporations and multimillionaires to start spending OR tax their hoarding and spend it via government, we'll never move to a millennial/genZ driven economy.

I think movies need to segment and provide in home and outside options to hit both types of audiences. People enjoy the movies as an experience, I hope that doesn't go away, but midnight releases are not the only way people want to consume content.

This is why I'm skeptical of most off-the-shelf solutions. In reality, businesses have some general problems (sales forecasts) and some specific problems (automating my process given a history of haphazard tool adoptions that all make sense for there individual pieces but don't actually combine together well). 

Why do companies have Tableau, Power BI, and Qlik? What will a 4th BI tool actually do for them? 

They have duplicative stuff because they have duplicative roles. This is on purpose, you can't have 1 of everything. But when you hire, you're hiring people with specific skills and that turns into X team prefers Tableau, Y team prefers Power BI, and it's prohibitive to choose one and transfer everyone and everything built in the last 3,5,10 years to the other one. 

Too many software companies are trying to be the 4th tech in the room, while selling themselves as the only tech needed. It's disjointed and doesn't work and adds headache. Better to discuss why some people will prefer the 4th tech, how the tech fits into the business as a 4th tech, and how the net value is profitable."

RMSE does so equally, RMLSE punishes underestimation more than overestimation. (Might have this flipped sorry, not looking at the definition right now). 

Similar to a cancer detection problem where you have to make trade-offs between false negatives and false positives (due to imbalanced data, cancer is luckily not 50% prevalent in a random sampling of people) RMSLE asks us to tradeoffs the penalty of being wrong (too little) with being wrong (too much). 

Not exactly an apples to apples comparison with sensitivity(recall)/Positive Predictive Value (precision), but it's a useful metric. 

But again, in terms of ""targeting"" errors for a model, I see RMSE/RMSLE as a different thing. 

I can look at a confusion matrix and say, ""cut the accuracy, we need better recall"", I can look at the RMSE and say, ""our training and testing split is wonky, we need to do some better cross folding before the validation set"". 

Those are different conversations and I think that's what I haven't articulated well when I said it's not an error metric. My point is that it's fundamentally different than accuracy and other goodness of fit measures."

Stocks for example have a tolerance range of price where nobody thinks it's a signal. Nobody starts a panic sell off when AMZN drops $4 since the last hour. 

If a $1000 stock fluctuates $1 each hour, nobody is really thinking about it. 

If a $10 stock fluctuates $1 each hour, you'll have billions of dollars lined up trying to model that phenomenon and get arbitrage and algorithm equity to profit. 

So a $1 RMSE (RMSE is in the same unit as as the residual) isn't, by itself, a good measure of whether your model is accurate or not, it is simply stating the estimate for the noise behind the true data generation process. 

On the other hand, if your predicted values on testing data have some (higher) RMSE then I think what Harpreet Sahota was saying is that the RMSE on testing data can have some amount of value in gauging your model. I'd argue it's moreso a statement about the comparison of your training and testing data (in time series modeling which is where my example came from, it's pretty hard to split training and testing and ensure they have similar distributions due to autocorrelation)."

RMSE doesn't really have ""trade-offs"", which makes it a bad accuracy metric for business problems involving prediction.  "

This is typically bad practice (although I did it as a beginner!). 

Gists are snippets, they would have a minimal README, if any. You can collect a class of gists on a topic and put them in a repo and treat that as a type of documentation of sorts, but at that point, you're probably better off using formal documentation tools and having a legit package with vignettes. 

I've enjoyed others' gists the way I enjoy seeing a canonical stackoverflow post: ""in this language, this is the near-objective best way to transform X in Y under Z constraints"".

For example, there's a gist in R that shows how progress bars can be used inside the content argument of downloadhandler for r shiny.

Separately there is a vignette on progress bars and a vignette on downloadhandler in the original documentation. 

Gists are useful as REPREX, but a GitHub repo is for active development where you are pushing, pulling, committing, branching, etc.

There is no ""force"" in giving someone any secrets. You show someone how you run your business because it allows them to run it in your stead. This does not give you legal control over their labor after they leave your business.

The idea that you have a trade secret that is legally protectable already exists, it's called a patent. If someone violates a patent, you sue them. But it's a very high bar, and your customers, your ordering system, your secret sauce ingredients, etc. most likely don't meet that bar. 

(2) is relevant because it is how the legal bar is met. 
(3) is a statement of risk which I expanded on. 
(4) is relevant because it's the only competitive mechanism for keeping talent, attempting to restrain the labor market through non-competes is not competitive see (1). 

The legal options for a business to protect their trade secrets are: 

(1) patent them for defined legal protection
(2) keep them a secret and don't tell people including employees 
(3) use other mechanisms such as NDAs for *specific* information (see Waymo/Uber)."

The reality is, we're no longer competing to be the best in our office or city. We compete with talent globally which makes it hard both to compete on being the best (more competition) and price (equally skilled talent located in a low cost of living area will cost less).

It's not a good story for an advertisement because I think most people would say ""just unlock it for them this one time!""; but if Apple wants to portray commitment to privacy, I think it could do so through a narrative of how it protects your privacy. Browser histories are probably not a good example of that, given Apple has limited control over search data on their devices.

Even with cambridge analytica and Facebook and russian disinformation, the average person is quick to blame specific companies, but I'm not sure they see this as a systemic issue of tracking, categorizing, and targeting people for content and consumption. 

Studies show paradoxically that people would rather quit these services that track them before they'd pay even a few dollars a month for them (i.e. instead of being tracked), and yet they'd require noticeable payment ($1k+) to quit them for a year. 

The Economics of privacy are that people have no clue what their data is worth and wouldn't know where to begin in pricing their internet privacy.

It has a unique volatility curve which is important because right now cryptocurrency is systematically correlated which defeats the whole point. 

Melon is a protocol for coin management, it automates nearly all back-end functions of a hedge fund including transparency, reporting, reallocation, arbitrage, admin, etc.

I see people say they use a NN and they get 85% accuracy and that's the whole bullet point on their resume. 

I have to ignore this bullet point because it doesn't have real meaning. What's the baseline accuracy? 

 In my above example on car accidents, baseline accuracy is 97% ""there are no severe accidents""; the recall would of course be 0. 

We ended up tweaking our model to have only about a 60% accuracy, but it's precision was 4x better and recall was 22x better. 

In our problem, both because of data imbalance and cost implications of severe accidents that cause long delays in driving, recall is a very important metric and false positives are low risk. 

It is critical that you set thresholds and accuracy metrics *before* you do too much modeling so that you have an appropriate business framework to work within."

(1) he gave up a lot of valuable variance by downsampling the FALSE cases. So I showed him how to split into training/testing first (I showed him an article on training leakage), and then upsample the most severe cases (i.e. with replacement) to get a more balanced dataset. There are always tradeoffs when you do things like this but it can pay off for certain problems. 

(2) the model was accurate, but it had terrible precision and recall. This was new to him, as all the literature he found really hammered on accuracy, accuracy, accuracy. Showing him how to calculate precision and recall, we talked about how your metric of choice is a business decision. There are situations where false positives are extremely dangerous and others where it's completely negligible. This determines the relative importance of precision and recall for your model. 

For example, in a cancer detection problem, the price of false positives is that you put someone through potentially dangerous screenings and scans, but a false negative can doom someone to cancer. 30 FPs to 1 FN may be too risky, but 3:1 may be fine. This means that accuracy may matter less and precision matters more."

They defined 4 levels of data scientist and the differentiator between the levels was NOT SKILLS. It was actually AUTONOMY.

You pay a premium to hire people who you can trust with the problem and don't have to babysit. 

Level 1 - needs code review, guidance, double-checking. Essentially they're in training. Typical data analyst new to a team kind of thing. 

Level 2 - should do code review just to enforce style and good principles but generally can be given a task and expected to return an output with minimal oversight. May oversee 1-3 level 1s. 

Level 3 - completely autonomous, can run projects, only really needs guidance in terms of overall strategy, but not implementation. Typically is coaching up the Level 1s and overseeing Level 2s. Typically 3-10ish people under their oversight.  

Level 4 - completely strategy focused, oversees the growth of 3s into 4s and 2s into 3s. Isn't granular enough to be overseeing 1s unless it's a large group and isn't really doing code review. Tends to work at the system architecture level thinking at the scale of platforms and applications. Typically 10-50+ people under them.

Syntax differences, R is functions, Python uses dot notation and object oriented stuff. You don't do data.sort() in R you do sort(data). (Don't actually run these they're just illustrative lol). 

Real differences, R is for statistics and statistical programming, python is for general programming and is the first place all the ML stuff gets made, eventually it gets translated to R for when statistics benefits from it. But Python's popularity comes from webdev and software engineering world where probably 90% of it's use lives (SE is just literally 10x the domain size of Data science if you go by people employed). 

I use Python when R doesn't have a specific package available yet, but generally do everything in R b/c Shiny is hilariously easy. Although now streamlit is growing in popularity.

I mean it's cool to see that Iowa is nearly all licensed stores I guess. But what's the goal of the visualization? 

Is it to identify patterns in corporate vs license owned? I think a state level map with licensed vs corporate as a ratio on a continuous scale would do that. Or even county level with lots of blanks for no-starbucks present. 

Is it to identify where Starbucks can still expand? Use a county level map with Starbucks/Population (you can make it bi-variate if you want to get licensed vs corporate, although that tends to be busy). 

The dots are also too big, they're like city-size. You're almost just seeing the row order (which dot is on top) not actually seeing differences in ownership type. 

I'm being a bit critical, so apologies there. Also, the projection probably isn't relevant here, although you can switch to an albers projection if you want to be more accurate in terms of spatial density of points within states."

Fully mature organizations typically maintain multiple S3 instances with differing amounts of data access settings and metadata storage to manage which records were placed where and when. Some use DVC, I've never used this, but apparently it's git for data. 

There's also custom blockchain methods that can manage the metadata of when records are accepted and where they're placed on ledgers. 

For small enough data in easy formats like .csv or .txt, git can also function as a data versioning system. 

Somewhere in the middle, there are shortcuts like appending metadata to records, e.g. Adding ""date added"" as a column for data on SQL server so you can get conditional extracts for dates based on record date and date record was added. 

My clients are typically in the earlier stages of the maturity curve and this isn't (yet) a problem for them, as they aren't actively monitoring data streams to the level where late data vs on-time data differences are being analyzed."

The phrase, ""missing a cancer diagnosis"" is correct for a false negative. 

I'll note separately that there is pressure to stop being biased toward false positives because it uses so many resources inappropriately, gives people false trauma, and the resources themselves can cause harm. 

Is it better to allow someone to have cancer than to have X number of people undergo medical scans which themselves cause cancer (e.g. CT scans raise cancer risk). Estimate is the equivalent line is X = 80. This point puts a floor on acceptable sensitivity and specificity of these tests although I don't exactly know how they functionally calculate these kinds of lines."

We'll see roughly 3 schools of thought emerge from this situation: 

(1) leave it in, just retrain and see what happens (all models get much less confident essentially) 
(2) try to ignore it or impute some new value into it (this is going to be chaos, but will probably work well in some industries that bounce back quickly). 
(3) throw out everything pre-covid and start over on smaller data in real time. (Inappropriately confident models that will fail to predict ""normal"" leveling off. It'll assume everything is exponential b/c it's a recovery, but may be highly accurate in short time periods!). 

I don't think any of them are more right than any other. It's going to be domain specific and customer profile specific. All you can do is coordinate with SMEs and try to adjust. Models are supposed to be applying numbers to real world intuition, anyone not modeling with a specific logic in mind is dooming themselves in these kinds of events."

The idea is AI is supposed to be this super advanced undefinable thing. Only the most complex and gatekept stuff deserves to be called AI. Or even worse, only true generalized Intelligence deserves to be called AI. Everything we currently have isn't complex enough to be AI because if it were AI it'd be too complex for us to have it in only 2020.

I disagree with this philosophy and AI for Dummies has convinced me that we should lower the AI bar. AI goes back 50+ years. We're always moving the goalposts of AI. Spellcheck would have been a mind blowing complex AI system back in the day, now it's just assumed and boring.

I was thoroughly surprised and impressed. It starts with a good summary of the history and how culturally, when AI (as it was known contemporaneously)  became highly effective, it became accepted and then assumed. Then that assumption discounted it. 

We don't flinch at spell check and we don't flinch at airplanes essentially flying themselves. These ""expert systems"" - intricate, large, but ultimately rule-based and entirely interpretable systems were extraordinary and then completely basic and normal. 

The book has other and better explained examples. But essentially, we move the goalposts of AI regularly and whatever we call AI today (GPT-3 chatbots) will be as boring as spellcheck eventually. To some extent we define artificial to be almost -""whatever I don't understand"", so once we understand it or solve it, it loses its je ne sais quoi and then AI becomes whatever the next thing we don't understand is. 

So to me, at that point, I'd rather just label AI anything that would have been labeled AI 30-70 years ago, of which many ""basic"" things would count."

The shift to calling everything AI has correlated with a large cultural shift and investment in data literacy and data education. Every company is pushing to be data-driven and data is increasingly common in everyday conversation (e.g. talking sports everybody is talking stats now). I think by lowering the bar for what AI is (and allowing it to absorb a lot of relatively standard best practices in data collection, processing, analyzing etc.) we can actually get the whole spectrum of statistics, statistical programming, analytics, AI, ML, NLP, CV, etc. to become more popular and better translated.

1. The README is detailed which is great, although I would recommend making it less technical and more audience friendly. A recruiter is much more interested in the business potential of your skills rather than AUC curves. 
2. Your code is neat but your EDA plots are not clean. This is one of several reasons I don't like notebooks as a data science culture. They make it too easy to work linearly and not be presentation focused. You have black vertical lines on your plots that aren't explained (at first I thought they were box and whisker overlays but they're not) and you don't have titles on your plots telling me the main point. 

Don't publish (which is what including a visual in your notebook is) a halfway done visual. Either complete it as a standalone object so that it boosts your *narrative* or remove it. 

Otherwise I think the repo is good and I agree with your modeling choices (although they could be translated to the audience a little more easily. You tend to default to the most technical definition)."

2) work with SMEs to identify if missing data is reasonable to impute - often it's not. In which case the amount of missingness and it's patterns may lead to dropping features. 
3) iterate on (2) and test out the changes in descriptive statistics over several imputation methods (MICE, zero, random value in range).

Ultimately we want imputation to be a value-add and if you look at imputation casually it's a major risk. 

My mentee and I are collabing on a project with lots of missing values and we're still working through the experiment design to take these into account."

Then you can pause and check your environment to make sure what you have actually looks like what you wanted it to look like! Many people are thinking too big. 

They want A -> Z but they don't pause and make sure that the letters in between are actually *in the expected order*. 

F ( G (x) ) != G ( F (x) ) 

It's nice when it does! But it's rare.

Our social services are overwhelmed, we have entire families living in cars, hiding because they're scared to admit they're down on their luck for fear of having their children taken from them. Our hospitals are expensive and byzantine, the least educated among us are thrown to the wolves and compete heavily with undocumented labor that has much better family and community support structures. 

We have I'd estimate 100-120M people (including children and dependents) who are a few bad luck situations away from complete and utter destitution and if that happens to them, our culture is to blame them for failing first and they have a ticking time bomb to get back on their feet because unemployment runs out, companies hate gaps, and landlords have all the power in most states."

History is how you understand a business in its customer context. What does it currently sell? What did it used to sell? Why did it stop selling that? Why isn't it selling something else? 

Appreciating that decisions are made under constrained information, history lets us reevaluate decisions with new information and understand if we should go back to something we threw away. 

I can't truly serve my clients unless I understand the history of their organization, the history of their funding, why they exist, how they've succeeded or failed before. 

It's like the stereotype of a 100 year old company hires a consulting firm and that firm sends 23 year old MBAs to fix the business when those people have never started a business, run a business, and sometimes even never worked at a business. They come in with just case studies and high level ""frameworks"". 

The young consultants that succeed are those that study the history of the business and industry so they know why other firms succeeded. History is the foundation of strategy consulting (in my opinion) and I see data science as a flavor of strategy consulting."

Similar to what I said elsewhere, you are using dozens of notebooks, where it probably makes more sense to have dozens of scripts and a single notebook to tie them all together. 

I clicked around a few of the notebooks. They have images which are cool but the code is relatively scarce in terms of saying what is actually happening and why.

I don't know what ""Advanced Regression"" is, I wouldn't use that lingo. I'm glad you have READMEs that detail the situation, but they seem to be geared toward the wrong audience. You don't need to say you ran multiple models and multiple visualization libraries. That's not really relevant. 

Make a specific narrative and embed images and tables into the README like a blog post so that someone doesn't have to review your code. 

Reviewing your code, it looks fine. I like that you have AWS Redshift items on your github too. But overall its a LOT of Udacity / Academic repos. It'd be better to have unique personal projects that detail specific narratives and experiments you designed. 

You also use a LOT of notebooks where you probably shouldn't be. Consider reformatting into scripts and then using a singular notebook to call those scripts with added detail so that the notebook is detailing 1 specific process combining other sub-processes. "

The AirBnB repo looked most interesting but it doesnt really link to a repo it just links to a notebook. 

I'd recommend providing as much info as possible early on, can you add summaries to each link in your table of content? 

As for the AirBnB project. You have some runtime errors that look bad, can you suppress those if the warning is not relevant? Also your outlier assumption is a bit strange. They are so rare they're probably not impactful enough to really drop. Be careful dropping outliers. 

The code could also be a bit cleaner in terms of vertical spacing (press Enter more often). 

You also don't really do what you claim you wanted to do- predicting the next destination. The notebook ends with no details or narrative, it's just a bunch of XG Boost calls. I'd like to have seen more visualization especially *MAPS*, this is a fundamentally spatial problem and you've kind of ignored that.

RenderUI(

This is very minor but it looks disjointed when compared to the long string of texts you put (e.g. your disclaimer). 
A trick you can use for keeping under 80 characters in length on the code but having more than 80 characters on the app itself is to use paste0 liberally (it makes paragraphs easier to read in the code with no changes in result). 

You can also use HTML() directly and it should avoid reading your enter key as a new line.

Take teachers for example. I've been one and it's way too little money for the amount of stress. 

I know some anti-teachers will say things like ""they have a union"", ""they get summers off"" [this is really not true anymore lol. Sooo much summer stress and the pay already is adjusted for this so don't double adjust], ""the average teacher is less smart than the average professional [this uses some pretty biased studies like testing English teachers on high school math]. 

But for me, ultimately, you get what you pay for. If you want better education, you need to incentivize it, if you want better policing you need to incentivize it. 

We shouldn't be asking people to take pay cuts to do good, because we end up disincentivizing doing good. Like sure, hedge fund managers probably generate more short-term financial value for their clients than a school principal.

You showed a lot of cool graphs (although I question some design choices like making the optimal number of topics line so thin and making your term frequency chart colored by frequency because the bars for rarer words became impossible to read as they blended with the background) but could have gone deeper on the *narrative* (what is the use case, can Zynga learn something from this?) And less deep on calculating coherence scores and salience and the topic distances. 

These are small nitpicks but I do hope you review and add more narrative context and more of the ""so what?"" In terms of how a business benefits from the analysis.

The tic tac toe project was cool, I was trying not to click on homework or assignment repos as I think recruiters are more interested in unique projects. 

I did check out the DL project and the R NLP project as well. Unfortunately, while the code looks structured, you don't really explain what's happening. I know you're calling keras to read in images and spit out outputs. But there's no narrative that shows you can apply these tools to specific business problems. 

I see this a lot, bootcamps or schools will focus 1000% on deep learning and never push you to show off your data viz and storytelling. 

Also your code tends to run too long sometimes. Find a specific style guide and follow it. In R, it's best practice to put spaces around commas and for all the text you wrote in your R script, you should consider converting it to an RMarkdown (Jupyter notebook equivalent in R).

Also your deep learning notebook should just suppress the epoch tracker on its output, you don't want someone to be looking at your repos to understand what you know and it's giant chunks of keras output"

I think more broadly though is that GitHub is becoming a LinkedIn competitor for developers, so it's a good idea for people to at least lightly keep it up to date with any side projects they've been up to . 

The issue i see with GitHub is when people have tons of repos and treat it like a portfolio (good) but their commit history is just like 1 date. 

That implies they weren't using git during the development process and that's bad. You want to make sure your GitHub is signaling that you understand version control, merge conflicts, branching, and ultimately the experimentation part of the projects and problems you work on. 

Again tho, not having one isn't bad at all, plenty of reasons you wouldn't have one. But I do think portfolios are useful in general and that GitHub is a good portfolio mechanism when done well."

The count vector repo, I think you should just duplicate the medium article highlights into the README, as going 4 clicks in just to find another click to a medium article (which a recruiter may not have credits left for) is risky.

My personal philosophy is under 80 chars per line but not too few either. It's nice to have compact code when it's all very standard stuff and then more commented code when it's complex or custom functions. 

I'd also note I didn't see very many functions but I know tidyverse kind of makes that not as important.

If your audience is more technical than the general public, I understand why you would push back on this advice, but the general public is NOT the LinkedIn population. They are people who watch TV and get targeted by propaganda that uses fake Y axis labels and fake spacing to trick people into insights that aren't real.

(2) I wouldn't frame collection --> visualization as a linear process. 

More generally, try to remind them that they use data products every day. Google maps traffic jams, their internet activity. The big thing about data is that the digital world is ALL collected.

(3) probably wouldn't bring this up. 
(4) would probably skip this too. 
(5) would probably skip. 
(6) I'd spend nearly 50+% of my time on this. And probably fuse it with (3), (4) and (5). So don't teach them directly that convenience sampling is a problem, show them visuals and tricks that USE errors to trick to teach them.  Show them how words like ""average"" can be used to confuse people's bias to this of average as ""typical"". There are multiple meanings of ""typical""- most common, the middle ground, the most expected/likely. 

(6)(2) (you have 2 6s) sounds fine I guess. 
(7) sound cool but time concerns. 
(8) weave interspersed in the topics. 


Overall data literacy is about not getting fooled. So that should be your primary goal. Convert your audience into skeptics who don't get tricked. Everything else should be supporting this goal."

A much better chart that is actively used in economics is the relationship between wages and productivity over time. 

Those chart show that (inflation adjusted) wages have stagnated while productivity has skyrocketed. 

The advent of the modern internet and personal computer area has completely changed the global economy but the working poor and working middle (*in OECD countries*) only have free apps and limitless amounts of low-cost content available for their effort. 

Some might argue that the value (positive externalities) society gets from FB, Google, and similar free at point of service mega-applications more than makes up for the lack of direct money-benefits of increased productivity (i.e. their productivity has resulted in large fringe benefits) but I'm not a fan of that philosophy.

The rough idea is that if you have 5 red balls and 5 blue balls in a bag and you pick a random 3, you have 7 balls left. 

Even though you have 7 left, you cannot actually pick 7 balls at random. You can only really pick 6 at random. Because once you've removed 9 balls total, you've eliminated the final ball's ability to be random, because it can be deduced empirically by knowledge of 5 and 5 going in, and 4 and 5 coming out. 

Now of course, in a tweaked scenario you remove all 5 reds really really quickly, in which case you eliminate the randomness even sooner. 

The transfer of this idea to math using regression for example is, if you have a prediction (yhat) and you have a model (yhat = Ax+Bz + C) and your yhat is unbiased (correctly estimates y), then for any standard error calculations you would note that for any estimate of yhat, knowing A, x, z, and C, your estimate of B is not free to be any value except the value that ensures yhat is unbiased. 

Relatedly for A given the rest. 

This is why you see N-P in the denominator of some calculations (where P is the number of parameters in your model including intercept!)."

My experience is that those problems are much later. Typically data is being collected ad-hoc and decentralized just because humans tend to be hoarders 😂 and THEN an effort is made to create data access portals, warehouses, etc. 

When I say ad-hoc, decentralized I mean that there are already going to be marketing, sales, business departments, etc. Collecting data for their micro-purposes (who last called this sales contact? When did they call them?), typically within paid software (Salesforce, or similar) or on their local machines (dozens, if not hundreds, of Excel files). 

At best, there's an ugly Access database lying around where poorly formatted Excel documents are dumped periodically. 

This is an environment where you can plug in an analyst to dive in, centralize crazy data, and start building questions and insights that inspire people to invest in proper data collection and management. 

You can't plug a data engineer into that environment without A LOT of political support for cleaning up your act, and companies OFTEN dump a data scientist / Statistician and get mad it fails..."

What kind of projects to do: -----------------

I don't know what you like or think is interesting but it's all about projects that align to your specific career goals and interest.

This is also something everybody seems to get wrong. They do projects on cancer detection and social media but their interest is retail analytics. Why would they show off projects that are irrelevant? This is actually *worse* than no projects because they have added distraction and now need to clarify how their irrelevant project is relevant to the company but it isn't.

Where to start: --------------

Learn statistics and build up projects using Python or R and get them on your GitHub.

The thing people do wrong is they try and do things in pieces like school. Today I learn A, tomorrow I learn B, in a few weeks I learn Z.

That's not how people *do* data science.

People do data science by having a problem, having skills in statistics and programming and business, and using A LOT of Google. Then they use git for version control.

Start today by making sure everything you are practicing is problem-solution oriented. Then as you program the solution, use git (I use GitHub for desktop) and your GitHub to constantly update your answer as you learn more. That way your GitHub has a commit history.

Most people just code something then throw the final thing into GitHub. This shows they don't understand the tool and they think it's a portfolio site. That's not what GitHub is."

Here's my general resume feedback and a link the to the article:

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-resume-doesnt-excite-you-its-boring-recruiters-carlos-mercado-1e

It's very simple. You are trying to convince a company to pay for your services through a salary.

So you must prove to them you have the skills they need.

Everything must be focused on that 1 task.

Your resume is a SALES DOCUMENT. It is not a restaurant menu. The recruiter does not want the added labor of figuring out which of your 50 skills are good for the company.

Make their job easy and tell stories (career narratives & personal summary) that are targeted, industry specific, and align to your specific goals.

(1) you can't contribute to the chain unless it's been validated (there are multiple validation schemas, e.g. majority crowd agreement). 

You could imagine like my podcast example, adding an appointment block which details which patient saw which doctor at what time and what results were, but if any of those factors don't align correctly and pass predefined checks, then the block fails to be accepted. Example: you can't add a chain detailing Bobby saw Dr. Susie and got X medication because Bobby doesn't have any details of disorders that align to that medication. 

(2) knowing when a block is added and to which ledger or chain and what the block details, and it's type, and the gap in time since a previous block was added, etc. Gives you some very useful metadata to improve your data collection process. You can understand the typical rejections, any slowdowns in processing, identifying bottlenecks, etc. 

The industry is changing and complicated and I'm oversimplifying a bit. There's of course the financial side of blockchain too."

If my client has a very specific process they do frequently and it involves pulling data, changing a SAS script to read a new file in a directory, and then running it, and then making a report out of the results in MS word by snipping images and typing boilerplate text, I try to break down each step into its inputs and outputs. 

What I find typically is, ok I'm not going to magically be able to pull the data you need however you need it, so go ahead and do that step how you're currently doing it. I won't be able to write the report for you in a parameterized way, so you'll still put it together.

But let's give you a web application that lets you upload files so you don't change your script to read new files programmatically. Then let's make sure to output visuals you need as nice, separated, pre-named PDFs or SVGs to make sure they scale well in your report and have high resolution. Then let's ensure that any boilerplate sentences, e.g. describing correlations or a table of top features or a confusion matrix, are pre-written for you too either as .txt you can paste or as a .xlsx you can open and copy/paste into a word table."

I know everyone's gut reaction is ""what no!"" But that's coming from some naivety. 

Yes, Facebook and Google bring eyes to publishers, but that's because they have consolidated the internet in ways that *might* violate anti-trust laws (FB CEO conversation disclosed to Congress THIS WEEK said they bought Instagram because it was a threat --they should have kept their mouth shut because that's textbook trust violation). 

In this anti-trust, illegal consolidation framework, you have to look at the downstream harm and say, these publishers were competing with each other for viewers (good). A platform came along that allowed publishers to advertise to people and people to view context within the platform (totally good, and a good argument against tech paying publishers). BUT what happened next is not good or fair. 

These companies started harvesting platform data (see related Congress conversation around Amazon and 3rd party sellers) and using that data to boost their position. Including summarizing that content and making it available to their users without the original party. 

This topic is very complicated."

TIOBE is skewed too! People need to understand that Python is a general programming language, so you can't compare R to Python head to head. You need to compare R for [insert target role/industry] vs Python for [insert target role/industry].

In their arbitrage activities they essentially determine the desired market cap every day which results in a new quantity target for the coin. The pattern repeats until stability is reached."

The idea is private currency would be perfectly elastic in both supply and demand in an algorithmic way, avoiding the risks (and benefits) of our current discretionary money system. 

Because the US dollar is a world reserve currency, people want it to be stable. The best way to have a stable (fiat, centralized) currency is low and steady inflation. 

Bitcoin is the opposite, it's designed to be deflationary. Only 21M will ever exist and they have to be mined taking up immense costs that increase the price floor at every halving day. (Don't ask me too much more, my Economics specialty is spatial/urban economics, not financial LOL). 

Other coins work differently. AMPL's idea is simple algorithmic short-memory elastic supply is  purposefully chaotic but within some boundaries thus being uncorrelated to other crypto (which are often hilariously correlated with Bitcoin itself).

Finance loves stable chaos because uncorrelated assets are valuable. They add diversity to the portfolio and reduce risk. 

I read a few years ago that several hedge funds were deciding to put 0.5-1% of their portfolio in cryptocurrency exclusively because it's so uncorrelated."

These charts are very useful for that situation. 

And you're correct, comparing illnesses is very critical for modeling, I said ""be careful"" not ""don't do it"". In the context of media literally lying and saying flu kills more people (it does not and has not hit these numbers in decades to my knowledge) comparing Covid-19 to the flu is dangerous in the casual context.   

In the context you're saying- hey how is Hospitalization, deaths, long-term issues, etc. for Covid-19 comparing to other primarily respiratory issues. Yes, that is not only smart, it's being done regularly. 

I think where we agree is that it doesn't actually look like public policy is being driven by data. If it were, we would have quantified thresholds. 

Lock down at these metrics { Hospitalization, deaths, cases } we are phase 1 open at these { }, phase 2 at these  { }.

It's an arbitrary cutoff, but I mean, the visualization is only answering a very basic descriptive questions. Today vs June 1. 

It is factual to say that AZ today vs June 1 is 3x where it was. That's just the fact. 

I understand that the average person may be trying to assess these in some context of ""general seriousness"" because states with low counts were getting the same media as states with high counts back in April. 

I understand that if you are coming to these as trying to determine ""general seriousness"" then 300% may be easily misinterpreted- the virus is not 3x as serious today as in April or June. It's always been serious. 

So to answer your question, no I would not say if a new model captured more phenomenon they'd say we're done here. 

But I think what we're excluding here is that this is about public policy at the state level, because (in my opinion incorrectly) the federal government has decided to push the decision making to the state level.

Some are not at that level of cloud infrastructure and/or their data is mostly static. So doing a NN to predict 1 column based on 10 or so other columns given a few tens of thousands of rows would be inappropriate. They're on the decision science side of things. 

Given that X is to be considered a true population for this purpose, what facts or predictions validated through subsets of this population would make me change my expected decision.

They asked me to be a manager and I said yes cause I'm a go-getter and want to learn. The pay raise was $1/hour but no time to sell, so no %.   When I told them this was a paycut because I was good at selling, they said ""you'll make more money since you'll get more hours a week"". 

Why would I do that? Make $500 in 30 hours or $600 in 60?

The science is evolving so quickly that it's easy to call someone a hypocrite or a liar- which even the most elementary understanding of decision science would refute. 

You cannot judge decisions based on information that wasn't available when the decision was made.

We were worried about runs on PPE so we told people to stay inside and hold off on buying masks. 

Then we identified the geographic concentrations and limited the spread, allowing numerous regions of the country to now buy supplies. 

Now we've gotten much better at managing symptoms and preventing deaths and caught up on contact tracing, so parts of the economy can (and should) reopen responsibly.

Also, there's the reality that what they ask you about in the interview may be irrelevant to the actual role. If you're comfortable, you should verify to what extent the thing you don't know actually matters in the job. 

I once interviewed at a firm where I had to plan and make a presentation on the historical accuracy of the Phillips curve (the relationship between inflation and unemployment). 

I felt I did well and they were impressed. But then learned they do ""constant"" interviewing and didn't actually have a role for me at the time, but said I'd be front of the list for their next opening when it comes. 

That turned out to be true, as I was called about a role a few months later (I was already employed by then) but the role was completely irrelevant to economic theory or analytics presentations.

Every class needs to be optimized for project based learning with defined outcomes from day 1. Every class should have sponsored capstones with local employers, organizations, and government. 

Speech classes should include speaking or hosting events for community groups. 

Business classes should include partnering with a small business to implement new product or strategy. 

Math classes should be working with local credit unions or companies to make projections and implement models. 

Humanities classes should be working with non profits and local government to talk to residents, discuss moral dilemmas / politics, teach children applied philosophy & morality & history."

Bayes theorem is that the prior distribution times the likelihood of your data is (proportional to) the posterior distribution; i.e. your updated belief distribution.

For example. I think tylenol is worthless for pain; I give 10000 random people a pain test and 100 say they are in pain. I give those 100 people tylenol and ask them how they feel. My prior belief is there is a 10% chance someone would have a noticeable change in their pain (I label this a placebo effect). The data comes back and only 80 are still in pain.

3) we need to have millions of masks and doses of sanitizer & soap available for when kids inevitably make messes and need replacements.

Not sure what we should do. There's some good arguments to be made that reducing animal consumption would free up agricultural space that could be very impactful on world hunger. There's also some realities that a lot of the world is vegetarian against their will and as their economies develop further they'll want to increasingly consume animals too. 

My personal opinion is that people consume animals due to misguided beliefs around nutrients (protein, iron, etc.) and of course taste, so we should seek to solve both of those through plants. 

Can we make plants taste like animals? Probably, we're learning a lot about hemoglobin and plant alternatives. What should a person who wants this to happen faster do? It'd be cool to get some resources. 

Can we make plants have nutrients? Well plants have insane nutrients, that's of course where animals get them from lol. But for the specific protein/iron, etc. argument: probably, there's some questions around whether adding nutrients post-growth actually gets ingested the same way by the body but I don't see why you couldn't just eat more protein plants."

It's true, the numbers are available, it's just funny to see people say ""the data is right there"" and then not actually look at the data. 

The data shows FL at over 1% of their population having known cases (255K / 21M).

This should be an astounding set of information. It should blow people away. And with nearly 5k deaths, the CFR is at least 2% without any excess death adjustments for mislabeling of influenza and pneumonia and this is with ample hospital resources. 

If hospitals crowd and hospital staff get benched by their own sicknesses, the CFR would skyrocket and with 99% of the population still available for the virus, the fear quickly becomes rational."

My imputation steps are: 
1) identify missing values across features and do EDA to try and understand any patterns in missingness
2) go back to data source / collection / business people and try to fix them by asking for data reviews
3) repeat 1 and 2 a few times until I really start bothering people
4) mock up the experiment with rows with missing values or total missing features dropped. 
5) go to step 3 with step 4. 
6) coordinate with business people on what makes sense if imputation is critical. In many contexts last value makes sense before mean, median, or MICE even. 

Use MICE before you use mean and even then, you probably shouldn't be imputing in real life. 

All imputation does is destroy the accuracy of your confidence intervals (arbitrarily too small) similar to not doing adjustments to survey data, because now you've violated the simple random sampling assumptions of many statistics models."

You may for example notice your data has holes where certain values don't exist, in which case assuming continuity of your data would be inappropriate. You can make all kinds of bins: 

Binary (above or below a certain value) 
Decile/quintile/quartile (use percentiles then bucket them) 
custom cuts (in R the cut() function will turn your numeric into factor with your defined breaks). 

The appropriate bin size is an art too. I am biased toward using Jenks natural breaks (maximizes deviation of inter-categorical means while minimizes deviance from intra-categorical mean) and then I use that as a guideline and lightly push the numbers to be more even looking (e.g. 234-387 I'd make 200-400 accepting some arbitrariness there). 

The thing to be careful of is defaulting to equal intervals. 

Equal intervals doesn't assume your data is normal, but it implies certain things about distributions and can lead to distortions in visualizations when the distribution has skew (e.g. a map of 50 states and 35-40 of them are all the same color implying no deviation when deviation likely does exist even if it is small)."

Take a big breathe and really think about the pros and cons of each IDE. Research them deeply. Understand that how you start is critical. Learn keyboard shortcuts, learn all the IDE features. If you're choosing #R (which I chose to start with, although I roughly know Python too) learn what each of the RStudio toolbar things do. 

2) READ CODE. 

It's open source for a reason, in R you can type any function and see it's body. You can see how professionals use whitespace, comments, commas, braces, etc. To make code readable and fast. 

Study up a style guide, look back at old code after a few weeks / months and optimize it. 

Again, if you use R, check out profvis, it's a package that lets you time code really easy. 

You can learn how to make faster loops and slowly get better about new classes of objects you may not naturally think about leveraging (e.g. lists, factors). 

3) Manage multiple processes 

Learn how to split things apart into their own scripts, the sooner you can think in terms of APIs and scoping and environments the better.

1) Equity Over Table (EOT) 

All visuals should be tables unless the equity is so overwhelming that you feel it would be an injustice to only provide a table.

Let me repeat. If your visualization isn't *easier* to understand than a table equivalent, then it shouldn't exist, unless there is an overwhelming benefit to do so.

2) Colors have domain specific meaning. 

In finance black is profit, red is loss. In other domains green and red may have meanings. 

Use tools like iwanthue (my favorite color choosing tool 😉 giving you an industry secret here, use it wisely 😂) to generate palettes that meet your ideal progression of chroma, lightness, and hue. 

Understand the difference between RGB, HCL, etc. Take time to learn color theory. 

3) The point should be the title, the title should be the point. 

The Title is the most important part of a visualization. People will disagree with me on this one, but oh well. 

Look up the serial positioning effect. People remember the first and last thing they see / hear. 

So if you can state your conclusion upfront, it'll be more memorable. 

There's nothing worse than a title that says ""plot of X vs Y"""

Why you shouldn't ask me to be your mentor:
-------------------

""Where people tend to make mistakes in looking for a mentor (I know I have, that's why I've never really had one lol) is:

1) they just spam ask for one. They don't do the work nor respect the seriousness of what they're asking. ""will you invest in me""- maybe! But I can't invest more than you invest in yourself.

2) they don't know what they want. No one can coach you if you don't tell them what game it is.

3) they think having a mentor is a shortcut. It's not, it's very possible the the fast way and the right way are totally different. You may be able to get a job paying X in 3 months or you can study for 6 months and land a job paying 2X. A mentor is there to help you find the balance based on your *specific* goals."""

Here's my general resume feedback and a link the to the article:
----------------------
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-resume-doesnt-excite-you-its-boring-recruiters-carlos-mercado-1e

It's very simple. You are trying to convince a company to pay for your services through a salary.

So you must prove to them you have the skills they need.

Everything must be focused on that 1 task.

Your resume is a SALES DOCUMENT. It is not a restaurant menu. The recruiter does not want the added labor of figuring out which of your 50 skills are good for the company.

Make their job easy and tell stories (career narratives & personal summary) that are targeted, industry specific, and align to your specific goals.

As for what kind of projects you should do. I don't know what you like or think is interesting but it's all about projects that align to your specific career goals and interest.

This is also something everybody seems to get wrong. They do projects on cancer detection and social media but their interest is retail analytics. Why would they show off projects that are irrelevant? This is actually *worse* than no projects because they have added distraction and now need to clarify how their irrelevant project is relevant to the company but it isn't.

Learn statistics and build up projects using Python/R and get them on your GitHub.

The thing people do wrong is they try and do things in pieces like school. Today I learn A, tomorrow I learn B, in a few weeks I learn Z.

That's not how people *do* data science.

People do data science by having a problem, having skills in statistics and programming and business, and using A LOT of Google. Then they use git for version control.

Start today by making sure everything you are practicing is problem-solution oriented. Then as you program the solution, use git (I use GitHub for desktop) and your GitHub to constantly update your answer as you learn more. That way your GitHub has a commit history.

Most people just code something then throw the final thing into GitHub. This shows they don't understand the tool and they think it's a portfolio site. That's not what GitHub is.

Anytime you have a problem in your code take a breath and a break. Use these steps to solve your problem *before* you go to stackoverflow.

Step 1: status check 
What is currently in your environment? Is there anything non-reproducible that you coded but forgot to save that code in your script? Can you wipe your environment and get back to where you were? 

Step2: wipe your environment and start from the top. 
Run each line or chunk slowly, make sure you know what class each object is, it's length, etc. Is every process getting the input you expected? Is it giving you the out you expected? 

If you code without thinking of the inputs and outputs, you're too trusting lol. Trust but verify. Especially when we're using 3rd party packages for everything. 

Typically step 2 you find out something weird happens and that's why your later code breaks (hey this function coerced all my stuff into characters! I need them to be numbers). 

Step 3: ok everything works up to your latest part. 

Now you can go to stackoverflow and see if you just have the wrong function or something. But before you do, isolate the problem. Is 1 function not outputting what you expect?

Autoregression is being correlated to itself (ie. To it's past self). 

Monday may correlate to previous Mondays, AR(7) for days of the week. Or maybe today's sells can be modeled by yesterday's sales - AR(1). 

Funny enough, while time series is the most common domain for autoregression, you can actually test out autoregression in very funny ways, such as adding row # to your regression. You'd be surprised how much phenomenon can be partially explained by omitted variables that correlate with row number, e.g. if customer X is in row 1000 and customer C is in row 500, you may consider them unique entities. 

But consider that you were at row 500 when you were a smaller business and now that you're bigger your new customers are different but in correlated ways (e.g. they buy new products or they buy larger amounts).

But it's not a full reactive programming backend. 

Even the phrase ""interactive dashboard"" is underselling shiny. Shiny is a full web application framework with 1 language that accepts JS, HTML, and CSS as needed. 

Shiny can automate processes (I do a lot of upload Excel get back a PDF and similar) in addition to classic backend/frontend support (connect to databases, perform calculations, provide inputs and parameters, get new calculations, etc.). 

The closest thing I've seen is Dash- but my understanding from overseeing (only 1) Dash development is that it doesn't handle things automatically the way shiny does. Especially sizing of objects, you have to really grind out the perfect layouts at a pixel level. 

Plotly is a cool API for getting interactive visuals in multiple languages, I'm not sure how much of shiny capabilities it can cover tho.

Whenever we make web applications not with Shiny, it's because we intend to do a full application and deployment with like PHP, JS, SQL, Docker, Git, Python, etc. But shiny covers well."

You can choose from: 

1) get them the original scope and let them know whether it's possible on version 2 (quality/delivery)

2) shove all the work in and sacrifice on QA (delivery/satisfaction)

3) plan for a delay (quality, satisfaction).

What also helps is remembering proper product management principles. The client doesn't actually care about the minutae of what's happening and how and why. 

They just need to make progress toward a goal and have stresses related to the gap of understanding of that progress will occur or not. 

If you're in a situation where you have competing goals of product completion, product quality, and client satisfaction and you can only pick 2. You sometimes have to make the tough choice and pick product completion and product quality over client satisfaction. 

It sounds counterintuitive to many, but if our team is in the zone, a 30 minute phone call quickly becomes 2-24 hours of lost work. We have to prep for the phone call, have the phone call, hear distracting information that we then have to vet and iterate on whether we understand it, translate the new requirements, identify what conflicts now exist in our requirements, plan a new meeting to pick among conflicting requirements.

The p value should be decided as part of the experiment design you can't just use 0.05 and then throw methods at it until you hit your target. 

Using MC doesn't really make sense here based on how I learned it and use it. I use MC when I'm working with combinations of different distributions (e.g. normal-gamma) to identify equilibrium estimates for when those distributions are harder to reason about. 

You're essentially using MC as a more complicated bootstrap / oversample. Again, this really just confuses the problem.   

N isn't large enough to be having problems with it's distributions. And the data probably isn't truly normal anyway. 

You can do small sample methods and tests to identify if differences are significant as defined in the experiment design. 

There's plenty of reasons that your significance threshold would *not* be 0.05. 

The whole 0.05 thing has done immeasurable damage to the field of data science in my opinion."

You're treating the samples as a population when using MC, it's not surprising that MC at any arbitrary runs (even large) returns different results given how small N is. 

If you get a deck of cards and shuffle it 100,000 times, it'd be very rare to get the same exact arrangement more than once. 

Edit: I say very rare because people don't truly randomize when they shuffle, if it was truly random shuffling, the chances are at the 1/ 1e50+, so essentially impossible."

We generated training data by getting SMEs to label a subset of our data points (text classification), we used an ensemble method combining 3 different NLP models to parse the text and classify them. 

But we learned that this wasn't an NLP problem. Because the public health people expected 0 false classifications. They thought we were going to match their ability to ingest keywords and context and perfectly map these groups. 

Once I heard they expected 100% accuracy, I had to step back and go to the basics. We used tf-idf instead of ensemble methods and helped them identify *their patterns* for classifying. 

Without realizing it, they always put texts with 2-word phrase X-Y into group A, never group B,C, or D. 

So that allowed us to *augment* (not automate) their task by providing recommended classification for them to sort by and review in a way that was extremely interpretable. Instead of the black box methods saying group C and then they read the entire text to verify. We could say, consider group C because it contains this phrase X-Y. Then they could go directly to the sentence that contains that phrase, and agree immediately, OR read for context and overrule the simple model."

It works by taking your data in N dimensional space and rotating it so you can find a hyperplane(s) that can reduce the amount of dimensions while only losing a minimal amount of useful variation. 

The simplest example is thinking about how OLS regression uses a line to connect 2 dimensions (x and y) down to 1 dimension (the slope!) While minimizing the loss (keep the residuals random).

2)  the more human management of a bunch more people, but hopefully we're scaling HR and operations, and mgmt, etc. too. Although I can understand the concerns of just literally managing a larger group that is less available.

So let's try to be optimistic and flexible and comfortable with discomfort when we're talking about the livelihood of millions here. We may all need to sacrifice but I think it can work out long term if we make it work.

Where people with more income and education have fewer children -- this is because the opportunity cost of taking off work to have an Nth kid rises as your income does- 

Entrepreneurs also face a productivity trap. 

When worker productivity rises, their pay rises (this relationship has weakened significantly since the 1970s unfortunately), which increases the opportunity cost of trying to go solo. 

So not only do we have regulatory traps, e.g. the hurdles of organizing a 401k, healthcare, etc. As a self employed person or small business, but we also have the trap that the best people at their jobs are extremely well paid, making it even harder financially for them to quit working and start their own business because of how quickly the lost wages accumulate. 

Opportunity cost can feel very paradoxical, because income and substitution effects (to use economic vocabulary) can be additive or combative leading you to unexpected equilibriums."

40M jobs in 2 months, no way those come back looking the same. Realistically this is the big opportunity to push the envelope of self-checkouts, online delivery, robotic process automation, etc. Less people more tools and AI and automation and robots.

We need to completely reconsider our relationship to work. What if the only way forward to make more jobs is to reduce what a job means? What would it look like for people to work 20 hours a week so that 2 people could share a job?

How much of a pay reduction is sustainable (it probably CANT be 50%...) Labor has to get it's share of the profits or we risk political instability. But profits are important for innovation. 

It's going to be a tough balance of reducing hours and maintaining productivity. I think I could output roughly 70-80% of my 40hrs in 20 if it was pure concentrated work. No Teams, no email, no meetings, just heads down."

This is boldly and in totality untrue.

If the intention was to do that, we'd block *tourist visas* - the ones individuals at risk of poverty can actually afford to get and then overstay.

The affected visas are explicitly a business regulation forbidding the efficient movement of certain resources by US companies. It's a test to see how much the courts will allow interference into US labor marketplace at the ""white collar"" level."

The simple truth is- this is an embargo. This is a massive new regulation that demands corporations ""buy American"" (talent). We haven't seen this level of interference into the free marketplace since possibly world war II. 

This isn't a tariff or trade war- it's literally saying that by being a company in the US you cannot purchase business services from other countries including *from yourself*. 

Have an employee in the UK who could make a major impact on your profit by working directly with your SF team in their time zone and building the kind of rapport that only face to face can build?

Sorry, that's not allowed until 2021. 

There is no job made available by blocking this. In fact, blocking the L visa (which was a troublesome but acceptable speed bump before) actually weakens the company and reduces innovation which could make new jobs harder to create."

Version 1 is done when the user can do X with file type Y and it returns Z. Version 2 will either optimize or add Xs or Ys to get new Zs. 

For more classic science, we try to define every part of the experiment (that we can) ahead of time. 

The data we haven't seen will be transformed into X shape. We'll do Y tests to make sure our sampling assumptions are valid. Then we'll investigate some set of predefined 10-15 questions that will essentially end the experiment early if any of them fail without sufficient rationale to continue. 

Then we'll run these cross folds with this seed ensuring this partitioning split. From there, we'll do X runs with Y burn in on each and we'll accept the feature selection output with the lowest [criteria X] in those runs. 

Those features will be passed forward for X survey adjustment modeling and the out that minimizes criteria Y under these specifications will be accepted to move forward with an expiration date of A or until model drift criteria Y happens, whichever occurs sooner.

Causal inference is for *explaining* something with the purpose of *intervening*. Otherwise, predictive inference with the purpose of prepping / *reacting* is a totally valid thing to do. 

If I predict the stocks go up tomorrow and I'm confident I can react to this prediction by investing today, then correlation totally worked! 

I don't actually need to know *why* they go up unless I intend to do something like push it to go higher via market moving or if I want to replicate the behavior in my stock or similar. 

They're different use cases. So yeah, huge agreement, these stats 101 ""gotchas"" are definitely overused. At best, they're a distraction and often they're just a means to ignore the results from an experiment and go to confirmation bias."

I have so much econ stuff in my head that is too superficial to be useful in any capacity. I can't really go into finance or monetary policy or international trade and be effective.

I think what these books do that degrees miss is provide a cohesive domain knowledge (my list is heavily urban design focused: environmental economics, city planning, development theory, game theory).

Also, my degrees both failed to cohesively push statistical programming. They used a hodgepodge of SAS, Stata, R, Python, WinBugs, Eviews. Instead of focusing on just R (or Python) and teaching the fundamentals of computer science that are super important- classes, O notation, coding style, functions, memory, etc.- through applications of the domain. 

So I'd push back on any requirement that the textbooks or papers I've listed be complicated in isolation for them to be successful, it's moreso that they fit together and include the tools to apply them.

It's very simple. You are trying to convince a company to pay for your services through a salary.

So you must prove to them you have the skills they need.

Everything must be focused on that 1 task.

Your resume is a SALES DOCUMENT. It is not a restaurant menu. The recruiter does not want the added labor of figuring out which of your 50 skills are good for the company.

Make their job easy and tell stories (career narratives & personal summary) that are targeted, industry specific, and align to your specific goals.

Remember that the average PhD takes like 5-7 years now, so the opportunity cost over a master's is HUGE now. 

I actively discourage PhDs, especially considering the rate of ABDs. 

Funny enough, I work with a lot of great data scientists who dropped from PhD programs and just took the master's and went into industry.

1) have one because it's expected so I post my resume but never engage (competition: resumes, personal websites)

2) have one to view content from people I follow (competition: Twitter, medium, Instagram, bookmarking others websites) 

3) have one to connect to industry leaders and engage with their stuff (competition: twitter, conferences, Instagram, email) 

4) have one to find jobs / talent (competition: resumes, indeed, conferences, icims)

5) have one to actively learn (competition: twitter, YouTube, Coursera, Udemy, medium, conferences)

6) have one to build a following (competition: twitter, personal websites, YouTube, medium)

7) have one to view current events from specific flavors eg. Business (competition: twitter, YouTube, news sites) 

People have multiple use cases, Linkedin needs to identify which it's prioritizing so it can scale. 

It's failed to be medium (weak articles), it fails to be YouTube (weak search), it fails to be conferences (weak groups), it's improving on learning (Lynda), it's excellent at resume dump, it's okay at follower building, it's improving on jobs but is top tier on finding talent.

 They want people to do the low effort join & resume dump so they can inflate user metrics. The next evolution is to judge based on user *use*. 

But overall I'm optimistic they'll figure it out. The stories idea is terrible, idk why they think they compete with Instagram. Their competition is email and conferences. I hope they see that and can focus on the core user stories."

False negatives are not always more dangerous than false positives in public health contexts. 

They need to be quantified. 

If the result of a false negative is 1 person getting ill (not the case here but just noting) it's possible that if the test specificity is low, that false positives are more harmful in net, if they lead to numerous people undergoing risky procedures and expensive follow-on tests. There are some examples of this in the cancer testing & imaging domain."

That's my biggest point I think, that a *great* mentorship is targeted and specific. 

If you just need guidance and some FAQs that's so more scalable but less investment. 

I'd note that when I say you might not need a mentor, I say so in the context of *a specific goal*. 

If you just need a job that pays X within 3 months that's not really a mentorship problem. Although a mentor could help. 

A mentorship problem is about moving up Maslow's hierarchy of needs, aligning to your goals of self actualization through fine-tuning goal definition, building up momentum long term, and catching you when you fall off the path."

I'm not interested in talking about r vs python for mature data scientists who have mastered 1 or the other, they've already seen dozens of problems and learned to think tool agnostically *because they've become proficient in the tool(s)*. 

But for someone at step 0, I think tools will literally alter the way their brain frames and solves problems, we naturally solve problems based on the context of our ability to solve them. 

So when I hear a problem about text, I think of R, tf-idf, n-grams, and more basic and interpretable methods *first*. I only bring up semantic embeddings and doc2vec and cosine blah blah if the problem proves to need those things. 

People from python backgrounds (that I've worked with) go direct to ensembled NLP methods leveraging pretrained models to do doc2vec and sentiment score, etc. That tool makes those things really easy and that's what they learned in their bootcamps and those models are very powerful. 

I'm not saying ones better than the other. But when you've learned an axe it's harder to solve knife problems and vice versa.

So I didn't have any ready resources to help me. 

In R, our company has a center of excellence in R, R best practice bookdowns, monthly R calls, multiple R groups, multiple asynchronous R courses, multiple R resource collections. 

Nobody who does or likes Python ever really started that at my job. I've never seen the community around Python, definitely not doubting it exists. It's too big not to exist, but this isn't rare. Friends at other firms and companies also note that R communities bubbled up at their jobs where python ones didn't. 

Could be that DC has a lot of academia types or something, or could be that R has RStudio backing it so there's shiny and markdown and shiny servers, etc. 

Even my clients tend to host shiny servers and use R and then python has to go through the virtual machines / docker teams to get used in production."

You can't learn to build a house through understanding the intrinsic nature of the materials and the physics that hold up the walls and the philosophy of the drywall. 

You grab some tools and you start small. 

The tool you start with has HUGE implications for how you think about these problems including not just OOP and FP, it actually molds the way your brain frames problems based on your understanding of how *you* would solve it mechanically (i.e. tools). 

We're a tools species, the idea that we are a separate entity from our tools, that we're some higher being atheistically grabbing the sword or the axe in some purely rational goal-oriented way defies hundreds of years of psycho-anthropology. 

We are our tools. 

If you accept that experiment design is a tool and, so is logic and so is the scientific method, you quickly realize there is not some higher order homunculus choosing the sword or the axe. It's an embodied mind with a set of experiences and knowledge of the sword or the axe guessing and iterating on which tool solves which problems.

Your resume is a SALES DOCUMENT. It is not a restaurant menu. The recruiter does not want the added labor of figuring out which of your 50 skills are good for the company. 

Make their job easy and tell stories (career narratives & personal summary) that are targeted, industry specific, and align to your specific goals.

1 project = 1 repo.

This is how we convert things like principle agent problems, moral hazard, and game theory into quantifiable things."

What are the future technologies that learning now over the next 1-3 years will allow you to skyrocket back to the position you would have had if the depression didn't occur.

My answer: 

Random error is the best error. It is purely just bad (or good) luck that your data was that point instead of it's expected value. When I measure the weight of apples to buy, random error is the tiny fluctuations of the scale that add (or subtract) pennies just due to the standard difficulties of weighing objects and pricing them instantly. 

Systemic error is essentially, any non random error. It could be error because I've selected the wrong type of apple, it could be error because the scale is broken and consistently adds several ounces, or it could be error related to the machine not having the right price per pound. 

Systematic error is the error that is controllable through a process."

More trees = more complex = more processing time. 

Typically RF doesn't need training/test splits because of the way it resamples data with replacement (which someone once told me is fake data and I disagreed and it was a whole thing) although there are methods that test the trees based on data that tree hasn't seen. 

So let's accept overfitting isn't as much of a concern, which is a major plus of the model. 

You should be taking into account *how many features you have* and how much complexity you want the RF to allow, as it will inevitably generate all kinds of weird engineered features containing interactions of the input features that may be performative but impossible to explain to someone.  

You can look into iterative random forests for help on this one.

The important thing about differences in variance is that it makes comparison more difficult (more math) and less precise (try t.test in R with var.equal = TRUE vs FALSE). 

It also violates critical assumptions like the normality of residuals. 

But... Take it a step further, if your residuals are not normally distributed is it possible they are autocorrelating? This takes your analysis into a totally different direction. Are you missing time series features? Spatial features? Is there a structural issue in your data collection? 

Correlated residuals can also imply you shouldn't use basic linear models (visualize your data and identify if maybe incorporating splines into your line can help)."

Predictive vs explainable. 

Predictive is biased to neural networks where you typically can't do a full audit of every part of the decision process, but it's highly predictive and you can use model agnostic explainers to understand the marginal decision making process - as in, what feature(s) (when removed) most quickly change the classification (e.g. LIME or SHAP)

Explainable is about *causality* - you model a phenomenon to explain reality in a way that allows you to *intervene*. 

If you cannot intervene, then explainability doesn't matter that much. If all I care about is if the stock market is going up or down tomorrow, then I just want the most predictive model, I don't care *why* it goes up or down tomorrow (maybe because I don't think the causes will have the same impact in the future). 

Interpretability is a third axis distinguishing why the model made its decision (in totality vs local explainers, which I wish were called local interpreters). 

Your regression picked 63 because Ax + By + Cz = 63 and this data point had a lot of z and the C coefficient is big. 

Your neural network picked 63.4 because the sigmoids and the hidden blah blahs... Well, who really knows."

My personal recommendation to SAS and similar organizations is to make the entire pipeline easier within the ecosystem. If SAS could serve as a server for containers, R Shiny applications and Dash/Streamlit applications, and others (e.g. Flask, Bokeh) that would be a major sell.

We expect that people pay a premium to live closer to work and that work is typically located downtown in tall buildings with expensive real estate. The homes near here are typically small and expensive and also in tall buildings. 

Above a certain income level, people pay a premium to have larger homes farther away because the transportation cost is relatively small.

Would you go to a restaurant with 1000 items on their menu and then a short letter on the cover of the menu specifying the restaurant is actually best at Italian food. 

Just take off the non-italian food lol."

1) can people estimate the value of something using a rational framework. Things should not valued at their cost- they should be valued based on their impact. 

If my resume advice gets you a job paying $20,000 more than your current, then the value was some fraction of that margin and the cost (here nearly free) is not relevant.

2) if they can't estimate the value- do they make the effort to gather information, here, reading the article and self-selecting either: 

A- oh, I don't believe in his philosophy, so there's no reason to send it to him and waste both our times, or

B- I can see the merit in his philosophy, let me go down the rabbit hole and reformat my resume and see what additional value I can get out of this. 

My experiment is showing that either the vast majority don't agree with my philosophy and simply self-select out (totally respectable!! I don't claim my resume guidance is a job guarantee or anything) or they just don't attempt to assess the value (by reading the article and following the rabbit hole)."

It's very simple. You are trying to convince a company to pay for your services through a salary. 

So you must prove to them you have the skills they need. 

Everything must be focused on that 1 task. 

Your resume is a SALES DOCUMENT. It is not a restaurant menu. The recruiter does not want the added labor of figuring out which of your 50 skills are good for the company. 

Make their job easy and tell stories (career narratives & personal summary) that are targeted, industry specific, and align to your specific goals.

The bias is to assume they are equal probability *until data tells us otherwise*. This is actually a natural Bayesian framework to have- with no data my prior assumption is 50/50. Then data changes your mind. 

""Is it going to rain or be sunny tomorrow? I want to go to the beach"" 

""I'm not sure, but I'm willing to drive to the beach tomorrow even if there's a 50% chance we have to turn around for rain"". 

The existence of 2 scenarios doesn't implicitly tell us anything about the probabilities of those scenarios. 

Having an informed prior (to continue the Bayesian reference) is dangerous (which is why many don't like informative priors) but it can be *useful* when that assumption is grounded in some history not caught in the data. 

Example of a prior actually making some sense: 

""... I'm willing to drive to the beach tomorrow even if there's a 50% chance I have to turn around, because last year in June, it only rained 13 days, so my odds might even be better than 50/50"". 

The historical information informs our prior estimate and now 50/50 isn't so crazy."

Whereas if I said the more accurate, ""in our sample data, B performed better than A and the difference meets our decision making threshold to switch to B next quarter"" they have the important info and no disinformation. 

That incorrect confusion of Frequentist and Bayesian relationships to probability could make them overconfident, it could poison their perception next quarter when they hear a different incorrect percentage and start looking into the difference between the p values as if they were exogenous things that exist outside of a model.

P values are unfortunately used by Frequentists to incorrectly get the value from Bayesian analysis without doing the tough work of identifying a reasonable prior.

Recruiters can't be expected to magically know how to effectively gauge every new role they are asked to fill. We can make it easy for them by understanding where we excel in the data science puzzle and improving our fit into these teams.

You have data, you make assumptions about that data representing a ""true"" population, and then you do things like t test to test hypothesis- accepting this data is representative, what estimate of the mean (or any other measure really) and interval around the mean would contain the true mean 95% of the time. 

It assumes you have one of infinite representative samples (technically not always infinite depending on the data*) and you want to make sure your sample estimate is not ""random chance"" extremely different from the population. 

This is the standard approach for nearly all statistical experiments and it leads to easy opportunities to misunderstand things like p values. 

P values don't actually tell you anything about the relationship between your data and the truth.

Truth comes from trust in your data and the experiment design. 

You can have a totally informative p value of 0.35 and a totally useless one at 0.00001. 

Bayesian inference uses priors (sometimes informed) to tell you the probability that this data occurs given an assumed truth."

It's very simple. You are trying to convince a company to pay for your services through a salary.

Everything must be focused on that 1 task. 

So you: 

1) choose an industry (example: finance) 
2) take courses on data science for that industry 
3) create personal projects showing you understand how to get data and do science with it. 
4) write a resume that is *obvious* that you are a good fit for that role. 

Don't copy others. Don't watch videos all day. 

DO an industry specific data science process with industry specific data. 

It is very simple, but not easy."

2) can you articulate the fundamental differences in frequentist and Bayesian statistical philosophy. Bonus for understanding how p values are *actually meant to be used*. 

3) do you have fundamentals of statistical programming: cutting numerics into factors, releveling, OOP vs FP, understanding of O notation, understanding that memory allocation and garbage collection do matter (even if you can't necessarily allocate and schedule gc in your everyday code), can you debug without commenting out lines. 

4) if I give you visuals can you interpret them and add nuance unprompted.

5) can you manage a meeting and ensure the meeting (which probably cost $1000+ each) have measurable progress 

6) have you worked within a data science or product team, do you know how data science fits into puzzles as often only a single piece. 

Leetcode and OLS by hand are useless, so is trick questions, rabbit holes, gotchas, etc."

1) you're using raw count, for full country list comparisons you may want to do % GDP and make it a map if you're going to have 100+ countries. 

2) since you probably don't want a map, it may make sense to only include countries with extreme values or countries with similarities to your target narrative countries (maybe 10-15 countries) of similar GDP/capita, population, total economy size, etc. 
3) consider weighted average comparisons like OECD, G7, EU, SEA, etc. This will add context while showing impact of individual countries affecting the group (e.g. G7 vs US vs G7-US). 

The narrative isn't that 100+ small countries have small trade balances in raw numbers (we already know that it's a consequence of being small). The narrative is that countries we often compare to each other and that have massive trade economies have different trade balances. 

But honestly, most economists don't worry about trade balance in the way you're describing could be a concern. There are so many services that cannot be traded (e.g. haircuts) that trade imbalances don't tell you *that* much about economy health. 

Of course *changes* in trade imbalances might 😜 especially for countries with low GDP/Capita."

If you want a multiplication problem- just say what's 2/10ths of 70 million. 

If you want a survey design question, ask what they know about the risks of using simple random sampling on diverse populations and see if they bring up clustering, weighting, and stratification correctly. 

But even some of these answers from others are technically wrong. 

If you have several easily undersampled groups in a population, the confidence interval would not be a simple 0.5M each way around 14M. 

There's geographic correlation concerns around how the data could have been sampled as well.

1) examples of the subfields- ML, NLP, Computer Vision, Expert Systems 

Your spellcheck is AI, you're just used to it.

2) understanding prediction vs explanation as a spectrum so you can accurately definite problems and potential solutions. 

If understanding why doesn't affect your ability to *intervene* then all that matters is prediction. If you could predict the stock market with 99.999% accuracy for several weeks you wouldn't care why you were right, you'd be rich! 

3) understanding that interpretability is different from explainability. You can interpret highly predictive models without being able to fully explaining how the decision was made through a full audit trail. Check out LIME, SHAP, and similar model algorithms.

4) true explainability is fundamentally *a causal analysis*. 

Poverty is associated with pollution- but pollution doesn't directly affect your income (it can make worsen health, which affects income) - but poverty can cause you to live in a polluted area. 

5) prediction is a framework.

I'm slowly learning the importance of *infrastructure*. 

Being tool agnostic truly requires you understand the client infrastructure. I've gotten a bit lucky sometimes on that and a bit burned on it sometimes. 

Otherwise the more I learn about product management the more I realize people don't know what they want - they know that there is a problem preventing them from being a better version of themselves - whether that means a more efficient or a less stressed or a promoted self is only partly relevant. 

So making sure that you ask tough questions up front and ignore the self doubt that says ""holy crap I am being so annoying by pushing them to go into more detail""... They *need* someone to get them to the user story level. 

If they knew how to get from step A to step Z, *they wouldn't have brought you in*.

Too much moneyed interest in back to normal. 

Although, coming from an economics background, I see commutes as a broken window problem. 

If people didn't commute as much they'd spend that money on something else- don't fear too much about massive losses in a flexible industry like CRE. Although heavily urban core focused CRE firms may suffer from people shifting to a life closer to home.

2 pagers consistently ranked higher EVEN AT THE ENTRY LEVEL, even when they *self-admitted* that 1 page is best and 2 pages is only for the most experience. 

Again, never assume people truly know their own preferences. 

I like 1 page things cause it's less reading- but I like 2 page things when I want to have extra information to assess something. 

Another bias that might be hidden here is the mere exposure effect. Simply holding something (or seeing someone) for a longer period of time makes you biased towards liking it more. 

Now- naturally the counterpoint here is ""Carlos- these people know they're in a study, they have all day to review these. It's not like they're at their job under a time constraint. When it counts they'll appreciate brevity"".

That is a great counterpoint- one that you should seriously consider. 

The answer isn't to ignore this evidence and assume the evidence-less position. The answer is to make sure that if you do write 2 pages, it is actually engaging, informative, and a good sales document.

It's very simple. You are trying to convince a company to pay for your services through a salary. 

So you must prove to them you have the skills they need. 

Everything must be focused on that 1 task. 

So you: 

1) choose an industry (example: finance) 
2) take courses on data science for that industry 
3) create personal projects showing you understand how to get data and do science with it *for that industry*
4) write a resume that is *obvious* that you are a good fit for that role. 

Don't copy others. Don't watch videos all day. 

DO an industry specific data science process with industry specific data.

(Edit: like David notes, engineers also use git and other overlapping tools). 

The dream scenario is DS works with Analytics & business teams to do EDA and work toward final model prototype and metrics for model drift based on usable sample of the big/flow of data. They translate the relevant business requirements into technical requirements for APIs and data pipeline design. 

Then they pass prototype and documentation to engineering team. This team details the pipeline into the specific architecture (i.e. actually choosing the database structure, identifying data validation steps), use Scala, C++, or other to get the final model up to near real time speeds, work out all the automated alerts for model drift, and put it in the production server for access to the other teams (e.g. sales, marketing).

When I said it's too late, I meant it's too late for people who just want to write good code quietly in the corner without talking to customers or being in an embedded product team. 

I used to be that person! Ijust wanted to get data, dig through it, make an app, and send it out the door. But that's not reality anymore. 

The options are: 

Front end- customer centric - statistics/business/management/sales 

Backend- engineering/scale centric - 
Statistics/IT/cloud/process engineering 

It's important to pick 1 and specialize. 

Individuals will always be able to generate millions in savings and profit using data- that will never go away. 

But the data is going to get huge and the problems are going to get *really* specific. 

You need to either get good at massive data or at aligning customers to the reality of what's possible. 

Personally- I can barely set up an EC2 instance, let alone write lambda code that will coordinate Sagemaker, dynamodb/Aurora, S3, and the billion other cloud programs out there. 

So data engineering is not a good fit for me. 

But I've been in sales, and I know enough about the technologies to identify what is and isn't possible. That's a whole job too."

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074241/

Summary: you repeatedly use OLS and the mean to slowly shift your imputation to a purposefully incorrect value that at least allows your other available data to be used in some way. 

Imputation is always risky- the best imputation method is to go back to the data collection methodology and find out if the data point is actually available. You'd be surprised what falls through the cracks but can be recovered.

Small recommendation as you keep learning:

Try to make all your renders a single line, where they are just calling a single reactive object. 

You want the reactive object to pass up it's errors and get cached and all the other benefits of reactives. 

If you stick everything in a render_() it's possible that you get errors related to the inability to render the correct type of object (as opposed to getting the error from the actual process you're doing). 


So instead of renderplot({ 

# a bunch of processes 

# plot

 }) 

You do: 

myplot <- reactive ({ 

# a bunch of processes

}) 

renderplot({ myplot() })"

I remember doing time series analysis in grad school and having to code every lag as a new column 😂. 

Sometimes the little inconsistencies of why something is a Proc vs why something can actually happen in a data step would throw me off, but I don't remember an explicit example off the top of my head. 

SAS can be really code intensive sometimes, e.g. generating hash tables.

R uses hash tables natively when generating environments which makes set comparison super easy. But my experience with hash tables is limited. 

But actually, if I'm being fair, I really like how SAS implements major machine learning fundamentals in 1-2 line. The partitions condition within glmselect is so easy to think about and explain to others. 

I would say a major weakness of SAS is the inability to cross over functionality. You can't do for example glmselect partitioning (e.g. for LASSO) while also working with Survey data (Survey reg). 

Overall, I think SAS is useful for scaling up specific algorithms, but it can be dangerous. 

A lot of chart outputs to interpret, a lot of assumptions under the hood, very powerful defaults."

The two options are typically: 

1) end means-testing of programs like SNAP/WIC and Medicaid. 

The benefit is that it reduces bureaucracy and the poverty trap, the negative is that it may inappropriately crowd out private sector initiatives that lead to efficiency gains (personal opinion is that the negative is exaggerated). 

2) define explicit ""wind-downs"" of benefits to retain work incentives. 

Benefit here is that it's transparent and reduce problem incentives, negative is that it requires typically expanded bureaucracy to validate people are in the appropriate groupings (see: the $5/$100 wind down of income for the COVID-19 stimulus check) and that it requires transparency in services. 

Healthcare is hilariously lacking in price transparency, so doing this would imply block-granting Medicaid which makes wind-down easier but has derivative negative impacts in terms of distorting how people spend when forced to deal with essentially two currencies.

 I'm asking that we treat deaths seriously, invest in national databases for contact tracing of victims, surveillance of their contacts, and a single country policy that has explicit guidance on calculating things like IFR, calculating risks based on socio-geographic differences, develop re-opening guidance that is science-based. 

We could have been South Korea. 

Having 50 different state policies is the kind of decentralization that actually increases death because now we're going to have 50 different American experiments. Except they're not experiments because if one starts looking bad, people will cross into other states and evacuate and disturb the other experiments. 

Individual decision making can only happen with a consistent set of facts and rules. 

Diversity without structure is chaos. 

The truth is, we have organizations and rich individuals funding ""diverse"" (geographically) re-opening protests that are going to get people killed under the guise is individual freedom. 

The idea that we can have a conversation about individual decision making and risk tolerance without having a policy conversation is begging the question."

Obviously we do have to make tons of decisions as individuals, I'm a growing fan of decision science, discrete math, and things that are much more of your expertise. 

I think the big point I'm trying to make is that we don't have enough information on things like reinfection risks, IFR vs CFR, etc. to be saying that individual decision-making is a viable policy. This is a policy question. Can individuals purposefully get exposed to non-lethal loads of the virus, get a stamp, and go back to work and play? 

Maybe!!! 

The policy question is how do we balance deaths from despair correlated with weak economies, the millions of human-years lost to lockdown, and the not overwhelming the healthcare system. 

The language ""certified non-lethals"" implies we know anything about its immunity.

We don't know enough for individual decision making to be the national policy.

Coming from economics the laissez faire framework focused on individual decision making is kind of outdated to me. Negative externalities are real. There isn't really an ethical frame for ignoring these lol.  

This thought experiment takes away medical capacity from existing healthcare systems (which is already bring back retired professionals and pushing through students). 

The thought experiment kind of misses the forest for the trees, people would opt-in to getting infected because it'd give them a badge of freedom- but it's never been about individual choices. It's about protecting the weak- and the idea that these badged people would go work in a nursing home is naive. 

Pandemics are a policy problem. It's about the seemingly inhumane calculation of deaths from despair vs loss of human-years by having millions of people putting their life on hold adjusted for healthcare system management.

The entire concept of judging the pandemic in a context where: 

1) testing is not widespread due to supply chain issues with PCR chemicals
2) testing is actively rationed to the most severe cases where it is available
3) there are 50 different isolation regimes in the US instead of 1
4) we have not completed excess death analysis (countless elderly dying in isolation, not being tested...) 

Is wildly premature. 

The fundamental fact is, case data is not usable without testing data, which we don't have. 

Not a single person I know under 40 who showed significant symptoms (inability to smell, inability to taste, difficulty breathing) was provided a formal test explicitly because of their age and lack of comorbidities. 

I'm not saying the doctors made a mistake- they all survived- test rationing is valid in this context.

- adjustments for testing regimes 
- adjustments for political divides over compliance with isolation rules

Liquidity: ability to turn an asset into cash. Checking account: easy, savings account: less easy but still easy, real estate: quite hard. 

Elastic = reactive to prices; can gladly wait until something is cheap. 

Open Market activities: the fed ""creates money"" by creating a bond and putting it on the liabilities side of it's books (equity = assets - liabilities). For example, ""this certificate is worth $150 in 10 years"". Then the open market buys and sells the bond until it reaches a reasonable price like $120 or something. This is a simplification. 

The confusing thing here is the fed can greatly impact these prices because in parallel they can change the federal funds rate-  The overnight interest rates banks pay to close their day with the correct amount of reserves. 

""Correct amount of reserves"" = however much the bank has out in loans (using their customers deposits) * the reserve ratio (e.g. 10%). So a bank with 1Mil in loans out must have $100k in cash on hand. If they coincidentally don't, they borrow from the fed at the federal funds rate for a few days (or hours). This trickles down into regular person loans.

Reserve ratio: % cash to ensure lquidity. Determined by the federal reserve too."

The federal reserve has been a massive success, so I want to be careful using words like ""manipulate"". 

US government debt is not like household debt, it's demanded. People want to store their money with the government even if it pays paltry interest because it's wildly safe. 

The fed doesn't print money in the traditional sense of the word, it creates liabilities (bonds) and opens them up for open market activities where institutions set the price through a free market. They ""destroy"" money too and it's good for financial liquidity. 

The fed can't do its job if it can't impact the interest rate. 

It can't affect the interest rate if private money is inappropriately cheap because hoarding isn't taxed appropriately. 

Low interest rates make money easier to spend, but *whose* money matters.

There's a delicate balance between 3 groups:

people who barely save disproportionately drive the economy through consumption of perishables, 

people who save disproportionately because their spending is highly elastic, 

The government that transfers value between the groups with taxes and subsidies.

Both worker subsidies and capital subsidies (infrastructure, education, public health, laws).

It's a vicious feedback loop and the solution is to stop printing money and end hoarding. it's supposed to be the case that massive savings leads to lower interest rates which leads to savings being less attractive relative to consumption. But it's not happening. Interest rates are almost 0 and our economy has trillions of dollars parked, idle, with nothing to buy. 

If we don't get these interest rates back up, we won't have the tools we need to get out of the next non-pandemic recession. 

This is a once in a generation opportunity to actually leverage this parked money through tax & spend, relieving the supply pressure will also allow interest rates to go up."

I would actually make this an SVG and use a formal software like Adobe Illustrator for a TV-ready version, but it meets the following best practices: 


1) All data could hypothetically be extracted from the visualization (all dates and values are available). 

2) domain-specific anomalies are noted - here I made weekends have pink backgrounds (in economic graphs recessions are typically backgrounded in grey or red) because depending on the locality, Monday may get a disproportionate amount of Saturday & Sunday reported cases. 

3) The axes are consistent in their reference. I use 0 for Y axis and instead of March 18-April 1 (which has no reference) I used Days Since March 18th. The context there is that March 18th was the first day that all 50 states had at least 1 reported case. 

4) The point of this graph is simple, if daily new cases grows linearly, then total cases will grow exponentially. So I made the point the graph title and sized by new cases daily. I removed the legend because it would only be appropriate if I had used a discrete set of circles, but the size here is equivalent to the height so I didn't want to waste the space.

1) your visualization must be not just better than a table, but *so much better* than a table that is worth asking readers to ingest the visualization. This is a relatively low bar, but some visuals (like this one) do fail to meet it. 

2) Less is more, instead of labeling each value (visual noise), consider a scatter plot, maybe even unlabeled, with a simple linear model (this is a special case where intercept may need to be 0) to provide the viewer a trend and a simple number (every day we find the same number of cases as the previous day, plus 50 more!). 

3) understand quirks from the domain. The dips in this graph seem to be on weekends, this makes sense in context of Monday getting a disproportionate amount of cases if Saturday and Sunday reporting is limited. Or vice versa, if people are waiting until the weekend to go to the hospital. 

Borrowing from time series, you can do things like moving averages to smooth out known spike factors."

- washing masks and other PPE for re-use actually makes them no longer protective. Most cleaners actually degrade the mask, you can't wash an N95 and have it do guard against droplets. 

- even if we get 180,000+ ventilators into hospitals, the country only has 100,000 staff trained to use ventilators at all.  

- nurses are trained on healing patients, not on environmental control protocols, having them wear 1 mask, all week, across dozens of patients, and asking them to perfectly turn over rooms for the next patient is asking them to add a 2nd job to their already insane overwhelming job and essentially pushing nurses into becoming sources of infection. Nurses in Italy are committing suicide after learning how they have infected more people than they've saved. 

- the collapse of hospital systems doesn't happen because of lack of electricity or water or pills. It happens when healthcare practitioners lose confidence in the system, you can't heal others knowing that *if you got sick* you would get terrible care and possibly be left for dead.

Develop a plan for skills development
Find relevant data
Analyze it
Present it in a way that proves business impact Learn and repeat until you're worth hiring.

The most important skills in data science are communication and self-learning. Because in the field, you don't get professors and answer keys.

 You have Google, stackoverflow, and your ability to find answers on your own. 

Sure, you have teammates, but they don't have answers either. They just remember how they googled.

set.seed(4)

x = runif(5) 
y = runif(5) 

x != y 

This is purposeful behavior. 

But 

set.seed(4) 
x = runif(5) 

set.seed(4) 
y = runif(5) 

x == y 

This is also purposeful behavior. 

You set a seed so that an entire instance of code (i.e. a whole script or a whole function) can be reproduced. 

You can't set a seed, do 4 random things, then the 5th random thing be reproducible in isolation. 

That 5th random thing is only reproducible in context of having set that seed *and also* having done the exact same 4 random things (in the same order!) prior to the 5th thing.


I used to play a lot of video games as a kid that used RNG so I've built a bit of a sense for it. 

Example: ""ok, to catch this Pokemon you have to enter the city and walk in this exact pattern to trigger the RNG on your 4th step in this exact patch of grass""."

I think the key takeaways are that with this knowledge you'll be better able to act as the intermediary between the DS managers and the DS recruits. You'll be able to ask the tough questions that make a huge impact on whether or not someone is the right fit for your organization. 

Often data scientists try to get into a specific company for prestige or money, without knowing if they're a good technical culture fit- when they ask recruiters for feedback all they get is- we chose someone else. 

That's super deflating. If a recruiter can say, "" we think your experience won't translate to the way we do X because you haven't had experience in Z which we need day 1 skills in. If we overlap in the future I'll definitely reach back out!"". 

If you say youre a python shop that uses GCP focusing on computer vision and I know I'm not a good fit. 

But recruiters don't get the important vocabulary they need to explain this. 

I know because I have to ask almost every recruiter who inmails me what their tech stack is and they act like that is an afterthought. It is literally the #1 reason to not hire someone- if they can't do your stack they can't contribute day 1. They could still be worth training of course."

Subsidy 1) VCs willing to burn ignorant amounts of money when even a duopoly with Lyft isn't profitable. 

Subsidy 2) Destitute drivers willing to trade long-term losses for short-term gains. It's extremely predatory. Uber's most profitable sector is coordinating the leasing of vehicles between high-interest car dealerships and poor people with terrible credit who need a job and Uber is the easiest way to get money. 

The problem is, the IRS estimates that maintenance for a car in commercial use is roughly 46-55¢/mile. 

These drivers are doing multiple miles deadhead (non paid driving between paid trips) and relying on tips to cover their minimum wage (the 60-70% of trip cost they keep covers some of the car expenses). 

Eventually these drivers who are making $5-$13/hour (in the best, densest cities with perfect driving scheduling, i.e. late nights, rush hour, surge pricing) get hit with a real maintenance bill that they couldn't have planned for, default on the car, drop out of Uber entirely (check driver turnover rates, barely any drivers last a year), and go broke.

Twitter is NOT representative of society, and it rewards highly engaging content- the things that make people angry and happy enough pick a fight or retweet. 

Journalism is so warped by the idea that twitter can be resampled in some magical way to tell us something about society as whole but it fundamentally can't.

GitHub for Desktop is amazingly simple, git within RStudio is a little annoying, but also simpler than command line.  


The basics: 
Master - the code / repo
Push - code goes from local to the cloud 
Pull - code goes from the cloud to local
Pull request - ""please incorporate the changes to the code I pulled"". It's for when you are participating on a team project. 
Commit - make a save point 

That will get you 80% of the way there. 

The harder stuff: 
Fork- make a copy of others code that you may pull request later. 
Clone- make a copy that you will not pull request, mostly for personal fun or for production where your code is one-way.
Branch- a mini-fork, where you test a new feature knowing that you will incorporate it if it succeeds. 
Revert- oops made a mistake, go back to a previous commit. 
Checkout- scrap this whole session, go back a lot, a super-revert. 
Cherry pick- a surgical revert, you are taking an old old commit and trying to recommit it. Relatively rare. 
Merge - the act of combining branches 
Merge conflict - the plural of developers LOL. When branches want to fight."

1) continuous posting of a role when there isn't explicit funding for a new hire. Very common for entry level roles where they hire a few a year, but if you randomly picked a day in that year, they wouldn't be ready to hire within a month. 

2) posting to gather resumes and meet internal KPIs for applications.

If more connected people engage with your post, then their contribution to your engagement is higher than if a less connected person engaged (possibly with some adjustment such as comments  more rewarded than likes).

R markdown and R Shiny are great holistic tools for people who don't want to learn a bunch of stuff to make an impact and businesses who don't want to hire entire teams to see results. 

I like R for individual work and Python+others for when multiple devs are building something together. Honestly, it feels like what takes days to do in R takes weeks+ to build with a team- but of course the team's output is designed for scale. 

If you don't need AWS/Azure computing power and don't expect a lot of concurrent use, making a Desktop shiny app works pretty well for a lot of automations. I've made 10+ over the last few years that just would not have happened if we tried to involve a bunch of people and programming languages."

Buddhism saved my life. I think everything you've said fits totally within that framework and I think people, especially in business, need to hear that more can't solve their problems. 

They say that humans are happiest when they are slightly above average relative to their community. That's why happiness and country wealth are so weakly correlated. The easiest way to feel that happiness is to identify ways in which you *are* doing slightly above average. 

Maybe you have a really easy commute, or you live near family and have weekly dinners, or you own your own land and have the freedom to do what you want, or you have the time to read books that don't advance your career. 

There's always some metric that you're doing very well in, appreciate that and realize it is desire and expectation that cause suffering."

My idea right now is to develop the MVP by myself and try and get investment through my current job as an internal solution development with some kind of equity split. From there it can become either an entire project, or be bought out by investors separately.

Shiny apps are best when structured like packages (see golem package). 

Big analyses are most portable and reproducible as a package (see renv). 

You should probably be making libraries and versioning the packages you use if you're trying to be serious about production level R (renv, packrat, checkpoint, devtools::install_version(), etc). 

Making things into packages gives you control over your functions (EAAF - everything as a function) including whether they export. roxygen2 is fully embedded in RStudio so you can do all your build and unit tests (testthat) the same places you do documentation.

I've reviewed an ok amount of resumes by hand, spending up to 10mins on each depending on my availability at the time and likelihood to offer a referral. That's probably like 50x what a recruiter can average per resume. 

They aren't fun to read. There's too many holes, you can't piece together what they actually want to be doing and if your role fits their goals, and they never tell you explicitly so you can bucket them quickly lol.

It's about knowing so much, that you can quickly bucket ideas into {no chance} {small chance} {worth pursuing with X resources} {worth pushing to get more resources}. 

Innovation can't happen at an individual level. So when experienced people have all these ideas but are pre-bucketing them before they leave their heads, they have a very low false positive rate (they don't invest in things that risk too much money) but they also have a significant false negative rate. 

There's a nugget of gold in there. 

Having inexperienced people to (1) act as a non-judgemental soundboard and (2) provide their own crazy ideas that you wouldn't even finish thinking before putting into the {no chance} bucket (but are forced to finish thinking because now you have to explain why it won't work) is printing money. 

Innovation is wild ideas/new ways of thinking + experience. We worship the young tech entrepreneur and forget the army of experience they hire / who invest in them.

I'm not too quick to blame student loans though; inflation is not quality adjusted. Today's education is on laptops using the internet regularly. The technology requirements of a university have skyrocketed, although not at 4000%+ like tuition."

I was acting this way, and I was wrong. 

Then there is the (big) middle where problems could at least be expanded upon to have 3-5 first steps. I agree that if you have a problem and it is reasonable for you to research a few first steps- you should do so. But there are definitely problems where it is completely unreasonable for the person who found the problem to really make any progress at all. They don't even know what they don't know. 

And of course, at the bottom is just complaining to complain. I think this is especially small, so many companies are hiring for cultural fits (I don't say this explicitly in a positive way), that they can end up with either only complainers or only the article's CEO types. 

It requires a cultural shift to have difficult, maybe not solvable, problems spoken about publicly because maybe the solution is to work around the problem and minimize it's growth until a solution can be found. This is often the case with technical debt problems. Where IT migrations could take years to finish."

Soon we'll be uncertain if we're talking to a person or a chatbot!- to robo-therapy. Companies doing telehealth are recording calls and the trendsetters will actually do prediction on what kind of language leads to appropriate ""less calls"" (some might quit because of funds or bad service- but the point of therapy is to not need it anymore right?). 

It also includes dashboard. People have learned (through nearly 25+ years of google) that answers are matched to questions via SEARCH. Soon we'll be asking dashboards templated questions and receiving visualized answers in real time.

But that's not really data visualization or a dashboard. That's just 1 step above a data summary. 

If you want to understand the structural and cyclical reasons that your sales are sinusoidal and make accurate forecasts that help you identify which stores are underperforming (as opposed to just being small stores or big stores) you need science. 

Expecting business people to be able to do #2 is just not reasonable lol. That's a whole job and specialization (which is what relying on another department or person is- specializing) is good. 

Companies that avoid specialization do not succeed; small businesses are dying. Entrepreneurship is at noticeable lows (for many reasons including high wages and tying health insurance to employers).

R has esquisse for drag & drop plotting (and it spits out the code required to make the plots, so it's easily changeable and reproducible).

Newspapers have high fixed cost: buildings, ongoing reporting, non-writing staff, broadcasting channels, application maintenance, etc.

 Their primary product is knowledge. You can't sell knowledge piece by piece, because anyone can copy knowledge by telling it to others and they don't lose it. 

So high fixed cost, with low marginal cost (cost for 1 article) and no means of blocking people from copying and giving away their good means they can only extract value by forming a ""club"" and selling access to the entire product base. 

This is how theme parks work- with 1 caveat. 

Theme parks are 2 tiered goods. Once you're inside the theme park, they have a monopoly on all goods and services inside. So they can afford to do both club pricing (annual passes) and 1-time pricing (1 day tickets). You'll notice- nearly all theme parks have these at hilariously close prices. It's like 20% more to go from 1 day to 300+ days of access. 

Newspapers would have to sell individual articles at almost their subscription cost; and to do so, they'd have to similarly monopolize secondary products. Like writer meet & greets, tote bags, gift shop items, etc. Which is not closely related enough to the primary good to make sense."

Exclusive means there is a barrier to buying it, pretty much everything has a barrier except for like air, water, nature, national defense, etc. You can't discern how much value I get from having a US army, so you can't charge me directly for it. (US army is a public good). You can't prevent me from breathing the air thats all around us (common good). 

Rivalrous means that if I have it, you by definition don't have it. So a toy in my hand is not in your hand (private good). But also, air in my lungs is not in your lungs (common good). Radio stations aren't affected by how many people tune in, so they are non-rivalrous. Similar to newspapers, once an article is written, it doesn't matter how many people read it or talk about it anymore. It's non-rivalrous. 

Non-rivalrous goods cannot be priced at their marginal cost. Writers write hundreds of articles a year, their marginal salary split among millions of readers is not a realistic way of pricing news."

I do understand that if you take the argument to the extreme, you'd expect things to be like theme park style pricing- where annual pass is only marginally more than 2-3 visits, but theme parks have a monopoly on other priced goods inside the park to extract differences in budget. 

Newspapers don't make enough money off their differential products (totes, gift shop, hoodies, books) for that pricing strategy to work."

Other countries are formally tracking NEETs (not in education, employment, or training) as they typically overlap with the 18-29yr old male group that commit a disproportionate amount of crime.

In a democracy, people (or their representatives) should vote on nearly everything. The acceptable income and wealth distribution included. 

If you poll Americans nearly 0 of them are actual communists who want everyone to have exactly the same amount of money. They all want hard work rewarded. They just also have common sense limits that billionaires are a policy failure. 

The problem is, there are people who cannot produce the value required to pay them high minimum wages. The people with disproportionate profits use these people as cover to keep wages low. And of course, wages = survival breaks our concept of ""free market"" (the free means without coercion, both from government and from death). 

So the only sensible thing to do, is subsidize the education and training (and as a last resort, the wages) of those who for some reason cannot produce minimum wage value (whether for physical, mental, or talent reasons). 

Then raise minimum wages according to reasonable inflation estimates (putting upward pressure on non-minimum wages) and ensuring that profit grows at the appropriate rate (inflation + the fair benefits from innovative and valuable efficiency gains); not from exploiting labor."

Vocab again: 

- Profit:    revenue (items sold * avg price sold at) -
 capital costs (amortized building cost, loan interest,  amortized machine cost, etc.) -
 labor cost (hours of labor purchased * avg. wage). 

Inflation implies that profits also go up (because profits will buy less things over time);

 revenue rises because what you sell increases in price; 

capital costs rise because buildings, machines, etc. go up in price. 

The question becomes: what happens if labor costs don't go up? 

Well: consider a 2% inflation in everything but labor. 

P = R - C - L  -> 
XP = (1.02*R) - (1.02*C) - L 

X must be greater than 1.02. So if labor doesn't rise, profits will rise faster than inflation. (This is essentially the history of the US from 1970 to present). 

Minimum wage is a floor on labor price. When you raise it, 2 things happen: 

1) other jobs that are more difficult or dangerous or dirty (the 3 D's) must raise their wages  
2) people must produce value at least as high as the minimum to be worth hiring. 

who benefits when wages stay low? 

- the people who disproportionately get profit 
- the people who have an inability to produce higher value. 

All labor policy is about those 2 groups of people."

Fast forward to industrialization and Karl Marx, people now live in cities and trade their labor for wages which is then used to purchase necessities. These people are nearly entirely without land (will be important soon). Marx labels these people inherently alienated from the outputs of their labor and are thus ""exploited"". 

The minimum wage is the mechanism for which labor is minimally priced; why is this fair? 

Combine all the previous points: 

1) land is fixed 
2) land is the only fair tax 
3) the country was founded on the principle of everyone farming 
4) free markets were considered only in context of ""surplus"" goods (survival was not tied to the sell/buy/trade of goods) 
5) wages replaced farming 
6) cities tend to locate on replaced farming land (reducing supply more) 
7) wages are now tied to survival (alienation from the output of labor) 
8) the minimum wage must include a fraction of the labor production and a fraction of the value lost from privatized land (essentially, funded via property tax). 

One last vocabulary (comment 3)."

-Minimum wage: deserves a big comment block. I could talk about this for probably an hour straight. 

The hobbsian view is that nature is the property of all man; and thus privatized property is inherently stealing value from the many to provide for the few. It follows that owning property is the truest and possibly only fair thing to tax. (They don't make more of it). 

The Jeffersonian vision of America was an agrarian democratic people; an acre of land has pretty consistently in human history fed about 1 person when it is not industrialized. 

The value of land is inherently tied to it's agricultural value, because that is lands fundamental use. We see this today where cities on good arable land are smaller in radius, with taller buildings, and less sprawl (Chicago vs Phoenix for example). 

Adam Smith's free market was the ideas that people independently selling *their surplus goods* (i.e. excess stuff they made that they didn't need to survive) would create the perfect price because surplus markets are inherently fair (everyone is selling and buying and trading with only minimal connection to if they survive or die).

- remove address; city & state is plenty 
- add objective, what are you trying to do & where (if open to relocation, say so). Say what you are interested in:. Marketing, Public health, finance; pick something. 
- if your undergrad is not from the US, say your citizenship status / sponsorship needs. 
- Pick your best skills (e.g. python) and be specific how & where you used it. 
- data science is quantitative; your resume points have no numbers in them. What was the problem? why deep learning?  What was the impact (in $ # or %) 

 Making your resume simple will show you're a good communicator. 

If I say, ""i developed an r shiny application using rvest and html to scrape websites for business development"" you wouldn't be impressed. 

If I tell you, ""I developed an R shiny app that  replaced an Excel database to improve partner selection on government RFPs. This automates a check of over 400+ keywords on 100+ of partner websites and provides an jnterface to search keywords and get the top 20 partners to consider for teaming on a government proposal."" 

That is more impressive because it explains the problem and shows how the tool solves that problem"

From MIT: 
"" [Extended job vacancies] ... reflect inadequate compensation for difficult working conditions, not a structural skill deficiency.""

Computer science grads don't have a significantly smaller unemployment rate than other grads; there are key markers of a skills gap that just aren't present. 

It looks more like employers are asking for more, are willing to train on the job less, and college can't pick up the slack. That's not really a skills gap, that's a reasonable ask gap. 

Plus, there are moral hazard concerns in surveying companies who want looser immigration laws and subsidized training from gov agencies so it's easier and cheaper to hire people with the skills they want.  

If you actually try and drill down to which skills companies are lacking, suddenly the list becomes a lot less technical and more people oriented (computer scientists who can give a presentation, IT that can talk to people).

Solar panel roofs - still pending scale and cost compared to traditional. But big potential in developing nations without high fixed cost infrastructure like electric grids, where individual electric generation is critical. 

Tesla vehicles- very high tech, but still uses a driver, outsold Mercedes and turned a profit recently. But Im not sold on self-driving if it still moves 1.3 people per 50 sqft of space.

It's just that these platforms don't care about individuals lol. The marginal cost of a Facebook user is in the pennies, and the marginal gain is like $1-2. So the amount of person-time-dollars a platform can spend tailoring to an individual is what, $0.25-$0.75 a person to keep the profit margin? 

So they use algorithms to scale the customization, but people don't know how the algorithms work and how to leverage them into getting the experience they want, but no person is available to help them. 

This is another area where explainable AI (sometimes shortened to XAI) becomes really important. Because people are used to be engaged with personally, and you're offloading that responsibility back to the user by expecting them to own their own experience. This is not easy to do."

I would say yes, it's a different relationship. 

I think the key is, and I hate to even use this dichotomy, to predict and to explain are different frameworks. So in explaining why one series would affect another you look into the relationships of the residuals over time, try to find some discontinuities that perform well, etc. 

In prediction, I think you take a similar route, but you underemphasize the discontinuities interpretation and shoot for the lags that are most performative under various cross folds (of windows). 

I'm in a Lyft, so this answer doesn't do your question justice. Kevin Gray is my go to resource for literature recommendations on time series. Check out his past posts for more insight. I think he'd have better ideas on how to think about residual assumptions (e.g. can you use Kriging and covariance matrices to consider the time series model as a spatial model?)."

Turns out, when everything goes up it's easy to bet that it'll keep going up. 

I will make a slight disagreement tho, the difference between a good correlating assumption and a bad one (given the same length of time and amount of data, etc) is domain expertise; which is really just code for instinct for causality. There very well could be a causal relationship between two very unexpected phenomenon overtime. 

The answer isn't to throw out every relationship we can't explain, it's to use it cautiously and develop markers for model health so that we can ditch it once it stops being useful. 

Production isn't a fanciful land where everything goes in perpetuity, all models break. I think I didn't fully understand this until I heard Ben Taylor's talk at DSGO19."

FOMO data collection. 

While it is related to the more well known garbage in, garbage out; I would call that a different worst practice. 

FOMO data collection uses up resources that could better be spent: combing the literature, developing hypotheses, developing a research, and of course- costs money in storage that only makes cleaning and processing even harder."

AI predicts injuries based on previous injuries, so that in similar scenarios you can identify if you'll get a similar result. 

But what did they define as a similar scenario? The players on the field change. The plays evolve. Is the AI going to tell you be careful when a players old, or be careful when a player is injury prone? Isn't that a bit obvious? 

Is the goal to avoid plays that disproportionately lead to injury? That's not really prediction. 

Of all your points I think (C) is the most important. Have your questions, then identify the process that will get you an answer.

CSS allows you to specify the borders, margins, and a few other layers of an HTML object (color, front, etc.) As a 'style sheet' that is applied to objects based on their 'div class'.

Unfortunately, this is also referred to as reactivity, which makes it annoying to have good conversation on shiny for mobile 😂 since it's such a keyword for shiny too. 

Typically, you should know what type of devices will  view your app ahead of time and then develop the entire UI to work across those devices. Single page / infinite scroll is a popular format that works across many devices.

You can also do fixedPage  (as opposed to fluidPage) and just have your mobile and tablet users use desktop mode. This lowers user experience but ensures the application will be consistent across platforms."

When you short, you are borrowing stock and selling it, so every gain is a loss for you, it's the same amount of skin, just in the opposite direction. It's actually more risky than a long position. Shorting also allows for hedging. If you are exclusively long on an industry, such as all the biotech companies in Boston for example, then a structural issue - such as an overinvested technology (e.g. Theranos) causing an industry wide downswing will wipe you out. Strategically shorting reduces the variance of your gains in exchange for reducing the max possible gains. 

We actually know what markets without structured shorting look like: crypto currency. An extremely volatile market. 

Also your example doesn't make that much sense, stock is only sold once; people reselling stock shouldn't have a noticeable impact on already funded R&D. If they were issuing stock explicitly for R&D funding, they don't have to go public and risk competitors betting against them (although that is a perfectly valid strategy, just like coca cola probably has investments in other drink makers - it reduces variance), they can issue bonds, nonvoting stock, lower class stock, or simply take out corporate loans."

Ultimately packages are just rewriting base R or other package's rewritings of base R to make a specific task easier. (And of course introducing C occasionally). 

Errors typically pass up from base R and sometimes package specific errors can overwrite these which can actually increase confusion on traceback. 

Also learning base can let you reduce layers of packages. Loading tidyverse and datatable in different orders for example can mask several common functions. If you can use base to avoid using one of those then that makes error handling easier. 

There are also client environments where packages are a security concern, so the more you can do in base the better you can serve those clients.

For a metric that can't be negative the assumption occasionally breaks down if the mean isn't large. 

Your idea of applying log to it can help make it normal (negatives are now allowed, so normal distribution assumptions are safer) at the price of interpretability and critically, could violate some derivative assumption down the line of your analysis. 

Here's a paper detailing why the use of logs to reduce variance (you can technically always variance hack, there are numerous methods for it) and normalize data can be dangerous. Log normal data can return significant results that are irrelevant in reality or violate assumptions of models you're using, such as normally distributed residuals in ols.

The philosophical question is does imputing Segment ultimately reduce noise and lead to better predictions. Imputation is essentially adding weight to the variables used to make it, pulling the distribution closer to the mean (your imputation by definition absorbs some amount of variance from the other variables unless it is a perfect linear combination; note many model choices ignore these perfect relationships algorithmically, so take care when imputing!).

 If this leads to a better overlap between the true distribution and your model's distribution, then there is probably a more advanced method that would more appropriately weight your non-segment columns instead of doing it yourself (unless you're able to access the true value, which it seems you can do occasionally).

Time 
Value

The trend of metrics (the reason you have a line instead of just the points) 
Category 
The correlation between value & metrics (the reason you put overlapping axes in the first place). 

That's a lot to keep track of and you've made it *more* difficult to read the insights by having not only all these variables, but in two different forms (bar and plot). 

Alternatives could be: 

- facet the categories 
- state the correlation between total value and the metrics. 
- make a new feature that details the relationship between value and metric and show that over time, with points sized as value and colored by category.

Alexander- that's a good question. If we take it at face value that this is a (A/B)/A = (B^-1) relationship then the x axis would be essentially time but in a random order labeled engagement.  

Similar to if we plotted mpg/wt vs mpg from mtcars; it's not literally 1/wt; but it's going to be loosely correlated noise. Wt and mpg are also both bounded distributions, which is important to note.

There was an update to dplyr within the last few months that made tibbles unable to be passed as data.frames when being subsetted for certain simple stats methods.

M <- as.tibble( mtcars )
mean( M[ , ""mpg""] ) #returns error 
mean( M[[ ""mpg"" ]] ) # returns numeric 
mean( as.data.frame(M)[ , ""mpg""] )
 # returns numeric 

You have to either constantly revert your object back to a data frame (because the as.matrix() portion of the mean method has an exception for non data frames) or do vector selection of columns instead of data frame selection. 

It's a small issue and quick fix and because the base R code was well documented and the error handle was clear. Comments should seek to clarify these kinds of things whenever the code itself can't."

But in the defense of commenting overall - there are plenty of times where you should be commenting as if it will be read by someone who doesn't know that specific language or by someone who won't know (or remember) some of the implicit assumptions of the functions (especially avoiding relying on positional argument assignment for a language like R)."

 R (stats) packages are typically built by individuals and tight groups that are actually stats experts. The documentation often almost as good as SAS's. 

Look into the documentation for scikit learn cross validation or the pandas API under the hood and you'll find that tons of methods were developed by the community in a hodge-podge fashion by non experts taking a guess at the stats algorithms. The same code doesn't necessarily get the same process done to it even across just a few weeks of updates.  The assumption that it does puts reproducibility at huge risk.

Until we make public space equitable to all modes of transportation: 

1) reduce real estate loss to road width and parking. 

2) improve public transit to reduce reliance on cars. 

3) implement guarded/separated bike paths for bikes and scooters on every road above a certain amount of use & speed limit. 

4) provide a full network of sidewalks. I grew up in top 100 US cities (population) where sidewalks where rare. It was assumed in the landscape that people don't walk certain section of road, including neighborhoods even! 

Then this whole debate on ""why do scooters go on the sidewalk, they could hurt someone's ankle or crash into someone at 8-10mph""  is out of context. Scooters are on sidewalks because car society refuses to share the road. Because local governments refuse to create cities where not having a car is a real option. 

On that note, the safest and easiest thing a city can do to protect pedestrians is reduce speed limits and introduce speed bumps. A car at 15mph hurts, a car at 25mph will kill you."

We designed everything for cars. It's cars who act like they own the universe because *they do* we gave them our entire urban landscape and let them kill 40k+ people a year. 

In the US, we are so car blind, that we actually have a separate set of legal rules for cars. If you kill someone its murder, but if you do it with a car it's vehicular manslaughter.

""Thanks for reaching out, I'm not currently looking, but if you think this is a can't miss opportunity, feel free to send the JD, location, salary range, and security clearance requirements for my consideration"". 

This weeds out: 

Contract roles that pretend to be FTE until the very end (they'll say things like well it's a W2 role - which is barely different than hourly). 

Recruiters who don't actually have a real professional relationship with their clients, they just get lists of roles and send back resumes. They won't always be able to answer those questions. This is similar to the next group. 

Phishers. They just collect resumes to reformat them and send you barely relevant roles always asking for you to also send in referrals for a few hundred $, which is more trouble than it's worth. Some even send your resume to companies you're not interested in, just to show they have a ""good network"" the company can tap into. 


You should do this immediately because you don't actually know the depth of the relationship the recruiter has to the role."

Typically in R there is some confusion over do.call vs lapply (I typically stick to sapply, or apply, I don't work with lists often). 

The key difference is that apply literally applies a single function over an array of objects, whereas do.call applies an array of objects to a single function. 

There is a ton of overlap in these situations, but in instances where you don't know the objects well enough to apply the same function over all of them, it may make sense to instead send them all to a function that contains different situations for different types of objects and provides a set schema of outputs.

I've taken classes where the language was an afterthought. I actually disagree with that approach. A lot of DS is efficiently transforming variables into useful features and fine tuning popular algorithms.  

I learned so much useless stuff like OpenBugs, SAS (yeah I said it lol), STATA, and ugly-looping (O^2 run time) in R b/c the professor treated the languages as an afterthought and didn't really know the production side of their domain. 

Deep diving in R or Python would teach students the importance of vectorization, modularization, effective commenting, the nuances of subsetting the same data.frame into different classes of objects by subset syntax, a million other things. 

We all can't minor in computer science (although arguably, high schools should drop half their curriculum and becomr computer science minors) so it's critical that this education is found in the applications of a domain (I'm speaking from economics) and because it's not- MOOCs (and self-learning) become a must."

There are 3 types of data in the typical internet interaction. 

Profile data (my name, demographic, interest, hobbies)

interaction data (I clicked X, typed Y, bought Z). 

Metadata (time/date, location, user history). 

Monetizing the profile data is barely useful, as I gave it away for free for other reasons (filling out my interests allows me to find others with similar interests, and I don't have to do it to use the service). 

The metadata needs to be highly regulated, as the article said, as location can be used to hurt someone.

5 of them I'd likely have to get a car to live in comfortably:
Miami, Austin, LA, Denver, SLC. 

Now, obviously, these are not the only cities with data science jobs or large companies. But knowledge workers go to where there is: 

1) a community of data science - this includes access to knowledge spillovers 

2) knowledge spillovers happen where there are a *critical mass* of jobs within an industry. A city like Orlando, while awesome, just doesn't have this critical mass. there aren't industry jobs just lying around, the throw a rock in a direction hit a data scientist kind of critical mass.

Exurbs are going to fail (no, self driving cars will not be a panacea here) and suburbs will splinter into desirable and undesirable. This is already occuring. walkability by design is key to making a desirable suburb and planners know it. 

4) foreign ""investment"" in the US housing market. Estimates for seattle square footage owned by foreigners exceed 30%, I will look into the source on this, as it may be outdated. In general, housing cannot be both affordable and an investment. There's a city in the US where housing prices grew an average of ~2.5% net inflation annually for 30 years. A modest ""investment"" return. That city is San Francisco.
 If housing is an investment that expects to pay dividends (rent) and increase in value (price) then it cannot be affordable (unless wages grow in excess of that rate)."

The literature here is expansive and interesting.    New metrics include bundling housing+transportation (should be <40% gross income),    others are based on %of mortgage as monthly rent (< 1% in the expensive markets). 

The primary conclusions to make are: 

1) housing prices are capitalizing future equity, this is a somewhat nonsensical feedback loop (i.e. bubble behavior)   a house shouldnt cost more simply because it will cost more in the future. 

2) the ""gray tsunami"" of boomers selling their homes. Some (in my opinion, incorrectly) believe home prices will fall as boomers pass away / sell their homes. the more nuanced framework is that top end homes (3000+ sqft, 5+ bedroom, SFH, aka McMansions) will crash, but mostly because of their isolated location.   The future is cities and density. Boomers are downsizing into the homes millenials (with student loans) can't compete on. We don't have 20% down or all cash offers. So the middle market will continue to rise disproportionately.

The world could handle 50 billion humans, it just can't handle 50 billion modern-consumers who waste 30-50% of the energy they access (accounting for food, fuel, heat, etc.). 

Really, the entire concept of Earth being overpopulated is lazily Malthusian. All projections incorporating the tapering of birth rates with education show peak human around 10-12 billion anyway. 

It's the unsustainable use of our environment (we use 1 year worth of Earth's renewable resources by August, it used to be by October until recently). That is the core metric we should be using. When we take more than the Earth gives it's a problem. Population is a terrible proxy, considering how uneven resource use is geographically."

1) The experience of a few sources of trusted information (the 3 news channel era) was actually an anomaly. The US functioned for most of its history with multiple biased news outlets spewing their perspective and people flocking to the ones they agreed with. The 1880's - 1930's was a crazy period of growth that ended in both the worst and then best period of world growth ever. We're in 1919 again. Although some may say 1909. 

2) I agree, I think there is a split between the educated skeptics who can accurately assess the fakeness of news and don't go on fake sites like infowars (right wing) or mindunleashed (left wing). And then the uneducated hopeful who believe and trust whatever tells them what they like to hear. 

For education specifically, once recruiting can catch up and ask for explicit skills and learn to do portfolio reviews then the feedback loop will set in and the best courses will become more famous.

Any players in the AI-generated modeling industry will have to be transparent on who's images they used to develop these models (both the math and human models)- which will inevitably lead to pushback when people find out their Facebook and instagram photos were sold to 3rd parties.

 possible explanations:

1) Algorithm bias against content length
2) Quoted content treated differently (similar to plagiarism detection doesn't hold quoted content against you) 
3) no hashtags. 
4) comment engagement treated higher than like engagement. 
5) the people who liked it themselves have low follower counts (not all likes are equal - low 2nd connection viewership). 

We know there is a purposeful reduction in top creator engagement, but linkedin claims that network growth should still lead to YoY growth in post views for top creators. 

Linkedin, being a professional site, should be much more transparent on how this system works. Or alternatively, allow users to better customize their followers. My feed is a honestly a mess. I probably view less than 5% of my feed for any measurable amount of time. 5% is probably an overestimate."

Instead of not posting, can you get a social media management app so you to write when you are able, schedule posts at linkedin optimal hours: 

Tues, Wed, Thurs  8am, 12pm, 5-6pm. 

Then see if that improves your viewership.

Personally, I noticed a huge dropoff in how often I saw your posts and had to manually find your profile and see if you stopped posting on purpose (similar to Vin Vashishta, who I noticed a large dropoff in posts, you two are some of my most purposefully followed connections). 


I found that you did not stop posting, I was just not being shown your content. We were 2nd degree connections. Now that we are 1st degree connections I have seen your posts much more consistently. 


I think the algorithm is also showing people content they engage with more specifically. The more I comment and like peoples posts the more of their posts I see - separate from any change in their post frequency. 

That would be contradictory to linkedin's statement that it is general engagement that determines if a N'th connection will be shown."

You don't have to defend anything. If they want to ask technical questions of everyone on the interviews that's fine, if you can answer them then you deserve the same chance as anyone else.

As for brand loyalty, this completely misses the mark for what loyalty means today. Sure, maybe in the past, people were loyal to a brand out of ignorance (didn't have a smart phone with every single item ever made reviewed by others with stars), but today people are loyal in their own way - it's called being the ""default"". If you prescribe to the belief that making decisions takes energy and you should not waste time and energy on negligible decisions - then brands need to learn to become default decisions. 

for example, I always get the same litter and cat food for my cat. It's a decision I don't want to spend energy making periodically, so i go to the same store (in person) and get the exact same items on the exact same shelf for w/e price it is. That's not loyalty, it's just a default. 

You become a default through investing in the nudge-factor. See Nudge, the book."

What that means is the government heavily subsidizes the research costs for industries that would be (are) critical for war. Metals manufacturing, transportation, energy, weapons, aerospace, communications,  etc. This works because the government stays in the loop on technological advancements without having to do the hard job of managing the workers and navigating a profit motive. 

But this is without any doubt, a form of socialism, in that there is a revolving door of people between government and industry, and there are lofty benefits, pensions, insurances, for those in the in-group *even when they are no longer needed*. 

Shifting the subsidizes (and tax incentives are a form of subsidy) of this industry into industries with a larger in-group (i.e. the poor, the old, the historically disenfranchised, the young & vulnerable) is called socialism as a bad word. But we already have state sponsored industry! we already have state subsidized insurance and state ownership, when it's deemed critical.

The ""billions in net gain"" is dubious, cities and states live on fixed budgets (don't print $s), so every dollar of that 3 billion tax break was coming out of current New Yorkers pockets on that hope that new residents pay it back without kicking old NYers from their neighborhoods. None of us believe housing creation would match the marginal population growth of Amazon. 

New York doesn't have a high tech unemployment problem; they have a trashed metro and NIMBYism problem. In fact, if Amazon actually wanted to be in New York, they could have declined the tax breaks and offered to subsidize transportation and invest in local housing. This is the crux of why regional economic incentives make no sense. States and cities cough up $90Bil a year just to musical chairs companies across borders.

example 1) To prevent functions from checking their parent environment for objects not in their own environments, I regularly wipe the parent environment while testing. This is mostly to protect from coding errors, such as creating an object in console but not making it in the function environment, then the function works accidentally and I get confused later when the function doesn't work later. 

 2) This also helps remove all the intermediary fake/test objects I make when verifying that loops are working as expected, that functions are returning the expected classes, etc. And saves time when I want to retain specific objects when debugging. Such as when only a subset of a list returns errors when using lapply. 

3) saves RAM (see (2))."

hundreds of cities and counties post open data 
kaggle has data

yahoo finance has data 
google analytics has data
google web searching can find you data 

and most importantly YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN DATA. The ability to simulate fake data specifically constructed to the benefit of certain models over others is a critical skill. 
Especially when you need to test the code is flexible. 

Personal example:   making an app that accepts time series sas datasets, excel files, and csv files, it is critical to have flexible and accurate readings of dates (especially if you are using less robust plotting methods like plotly) that is tuned to each file type.

I actively make fake data with different date formats, different seasonalities, different time trends, etc. to make sure the app performs as expected when given inputs that are realistic to the end users skill sets."

profit = revenue - laborcosts - nonlabor costs

raise revenue and nonlabor by 2% and keep laborcosts (i.e. minimum wage) the same. 

Xprofit = 1.02R - 1L - 1.02NL 

profit has now risen by more 2%. Because profit has been extracted from the wages not rising with inflation - i.e. labor has experienced a pay cut. 


This is the fundamental mechanism that requires us to raise minimum wages at least by inflation. 

As for raising it in general. In economics we say that people are paid their marginal product of labor - that is, they are paid for their productivity. 

The research is still out, but often we find the opposite relationship - that people produce to their pay. When you pay people more, (in general, for people who arent scumbags) it induces them to try harder, it validates their hard work, and proves that their effort will be rewarded with increasing pay, status, etc. 

In this case, while the data possibly could've been normalized for population growth & compared to growth of jobs in other sectors, I think there's both pro- and anti- arguments... (cont'd)"

And even when you do ""apples to apples"" (which is intrinsically unfair, since there are structural issues that lead to 25-40 year old women to being statistically significantly out of the labor force in prime promotion years - i.e. weak parental leave) there still exists the discrimination from the negotiations gap (estimates for this range from 3-10%, but remember this compounds over time AND feedbacks to the structural issue stated above)."

I remember watching a cooking competition of Netflix, the very first episode a contestant talked back to the head chef after being eliminated from the challenge in record time (unsanitary tasting of an ingredient, he stuck his finger right into the pot). 
Later in the episode everyone was hoping (praying even) that he was some kind of amazing chef - so amazing that his arrogance and rudeness would somehow be validated by his unparalleled skill [we're funny like that, we tolerate things from ""genius"" that no one would tolerate from average]. 

He did a terrible job, his food was inedible, and he was eliminated from the entire contest. 

They gave him the benefit of the doubt and he failed. I think Liz is saying that there is a range of overconfident behavior that deserves a range of benefit of the doubt. You'll have to play it by ear. But at the end of the day, if they can't keep up, cut them.

In government contracting that would mean congratulating opposing firms when they win big contracts, keeping connected to their employees, not stressing when your employees leave to competitors, never burning bridges, happily providing references, providing great referall bonuses, being a human being when it comes to bereavement, parental leave, flexibility, etc.

The thing about optimal strategies is that they should be robust to a wide range of situations and markets. The benefits of outreach and being human possibly work !even better! in employer-biased markets - they are just absolutely necessary in today's market.

Sometimes we act like 2007-2009, no firms succeeded, they just survived. That isn't true. Plenty of firms grew during the Great Recession, and I would wager their forward-thinking HR practices helped. "

Outreach is the missing ingredient in both, great post Liz. 

Your own interview pipeline is a talent pool waiting to be used. Tell candidates how many jobs you're looking to fill [including salary ranges!!], invite them to recommend their friends, classmates, and coworkers to apply too. 

It sounds crazy - but that's what interviewing is supposed to be. Is this a good fit for me? no, but it's a good fit for someone else. It's not always a competition to see who ""wins"" the job. Wins only happen when good matches happen.

Start doing the same with your own competitors - you're not a good fit for us, but an HR colleague at a different firm may be interested in your profile. We've spent 3 hours interviewing by phone and in person, I'm comfortable recommending you to them.

Be a human being and reap the rewards."

Ask about past mistakes and their resolutions (and most importantly reveal company mistakes and their resolution!). You'll get more honest answers. 

These questions are fundamentally about emotionally manipulating an employee to see the negatives about themselves and do worse in a negotiation.

 Yes, I know, that's not the goal- HR wants confident, self aware, self-learning, innovative employees; but this question (without an equal disclosure of the company's weaknesses and failures) is manipulative.

The issue I see is that a lot of departments are still behind on getting technical recruiters with industry specific experience.

title inflation -  my understanding is you started a website and you run it yourself; I mistake I made after founding my LLC to do consulting work was that ""founder | ceo"" wasnt really as relevant as I had hoped it would be. Focus more in what you would title yourself if you did that exact work at a company. Data analyst/research analyst/ economist etc. 
school focus -   its great that you took interesting, relevant coursework and had honors. But in DC, its masters degree or bust with wayyy too many jobs. I would focus on what exact things you did in STATA that were unique (i.e. not OLS on Boston mortgages in 1996 like every econometrics class does lol)   and expand your technical skills section to detail what you have done (independent work is fine) with your skills:   especially if you know Python, R, ML, AWS, tensorflow, or related.

These cities are starting from a disadvantage- that the 60s and 70s and 80s left many of them with decaying segregated central cores with inequality in education and infrastructure. Cities that can get ahead of this and make headlines for their efforts to fix these problems are the ones getting 2nd notice from young people ( nashville, charlotte, charleston, birmingham are some well known for their startup scenes that are moving slowly in the right direction here). 

I don't know enough about PA to get too specific. But infrastructure, inequality/inequity, inclusive urban design, planned walkable communities, affordability,    those are the things that make young people say ""its not a big place, but its the right place"".

Small cities can still attract young people using some of what you mentioned - startup funds, strong community ties, etc. But the effect will be limited (Vermont is going as far as to pay people to live there while working remote).

Infrastructure - look at OKC, tulsa, kansas city, nashville, colorado springs.

Analyst - is given tasks, data, and tools. Not to make this sound easy - there may be a lot of valuable exploration, scripting, and creativity in this role - but it is by definition limited in its scale. 

Data scientist - creates tasks based on business value, compiles data and works with engineers (if applicable) to create/design architecture required to get data in the correct form, creates the tools that they or analysts will use (ML models, Shiny Apps, and similar), passes down tasks to analyst and trains them up to DS. 

I would find it disappointing and shortsighted to hear a company want an analyst and not take a want-to-be data scientist. It's just like a research assistant that wants to be a chemist, economist, etc. It's the natural first step - even if often the titles are not ""analyst"" the role makes sense. 


I'm a DS because I independently find ways to make business value through automation, EDA, NLP, etc and use R, tableau, excel, sql, html, whatever I can find, to do it. If I was told exactly how to best do what I do and given the tools and the data then that'd make me an analyst."

Soccer match attendance is going to have a lot of collinearity   - the best teams get the best time slots   and both lead to higher attendance. So they may receive a disproportionate number of attendees and your data may not be large or varied enough to accurately split those two measures.     As for prediction, are you just testing with a confusion matrix or are you using other model accuracy criteria (AIC?, R^2)        I would look at attendance normalized and try to determine which factors most strongly lead to attendance beyond some interval.  Low can be < 1 standard deviations, high can be > 1.   So ~70% of games are medium attendance.    Of course,  since soccer games have a fixed cost component there's also the survivor bias since games with low attendance predicted are canceled or rescheduled."

The young kids today know Facebook is for grandmas (sorry, but yes, Facebook will be MySpace sooner than you think), so they use instagram (actually, they use finstas - which means the fake instagrams they hide from their parents). 
Snapchat's only edge on instagram is that it's still seen as the ""playful"" version of 24hr lifespan photos and videos; whereas instagram still has a certain ""quality floor"", likely because snapchat messages are also unsaved, whereas instagram messages go into your DMs if you message someone a reply to their 24hr story.  
Snapchat either needs to A:  Incorporate long-term photos as well (becoming a weaker instagram) or B: pray that facebook forces instagram to kill off all the finstas, fake accounts, and drug dealers (yes - your kid is buying drugs off instagram with the accounts they don't let you follow) by enforcing online identities [thus, killing instagram for Gen Z].

1. Land is different than all other capital - it is in fixed supply and is endowed by nature. The supply curve is completely vertical;  there is no shock can increase or decrease its supply; only change its optimal use/price.  

2. Food is different from all other commodities. Yes of course, when hot dogs are expensive people by hamburgers instead, but food as a category is a must-buy. 

This means a) in a free market it's price is highly volatile and b) there are political reasons to keep food affordable (the french revolution, the arab spring, were are highly correlated to bread price shocks). 

3. For political purposes, the price of food must be affordable to *the entire population*. 

4. Affordable/cheap products are not necessarily the most profitable. 

5. It is profit that is reinvested into the company spur innovation and lower marginal costs (and thus lower price + increase quantity sold). 

The paradox: high food prices allow for profit and innovation; but food can't be priced high politically. So the equilibrium in the real world is that the government subsidizes the profit needed to spur innovation in food. There is also sequential game theory involved, but i'm out of characters."

I feel like the examples of cronyism given are relatively small considering the externalities and subsidies that have been accepted/given to the fossil fuel industry over the past 100+ years. 

Of course, the government shouldnt pick winners, but if theyve already given A a head start it would seem strange to argue that B should be left to the free market to develop."

1) your competitors probably make more data than you. Data is unreasonably effective. 

All the fancy AI stuff you hear about at workshops? those algorithms are from the 70s. We just finally have more data and fast computers. (i include this, but wouldn't say this if i were actually selling data science as an investment)

2) your competitors definitely make better data than you, since you haven't invested in data science. So you're even further behind than day 1. Their first 100 days was probably all spent on data architecture. 

3)  the fundamentals of business -pricing, quantities to buy, inventory, sellers, supply chain. Without data science, you're making gut science decisions.

This is where corporate social responsibility becomes a factor. When companies provide volunteer time off, take corporate trips together to help their community, network with community partners and otherwise engage people they don't get direct business value from. 

Corporate authenticity is a buzzword, but it's rooted in a real, but difficult, and sometimes costly cultural adjustment. Companies that think in the short-term (quarterly stock prices, raising funds for buybacks, flashy new offices to impress clients, raising expense account limits to keep the C-levels happy)  will struggle with validating these activities to the entire decision-system. This doesn't mean they'll go bankrupt or fail to profit or innovate. It's just that they won't be considered leaders. "

But if we accept the premise that it's a candidate's market (I don't accept this premise because it's really just a few narrow fields in my opinion) then eventually companies would have to adapt again and start selling themselves to clients instead of stoically demanding candidates bend to their whims and grovel for jobs.

P) flexibility, motivated individuals can bring innovation, cheap 
C) Uncoordinated growth, isolated or weakly accountable 

I think the separation (loss?) of corporations training their employees last-mile skills is bad. 

Employees are crunched, the numbers say unemployment is low, but underemployment is high. People graduating from 2008-2011 who didnt get entry level jobs or struggled with unemployment are competing with more new graduates every year. Also, over 80% of jobs created since 2011 have gone to people with at least *some* college. And only 30% of 29 year olds have a bachelors degree. 

Because the responsibility (and cost) of education and certification has been moved to the candidate- we have this ""skills gap"". But for comparable positions a generation ago- the minimum viable candidate rarely included last-mile skills. This gives employers more leverage and lower costs. They can overwork employees scared to be unemployed (again). While waiting for candidates to pay for their own last-mile education before hiring them. 
This has numerous sociological consequences, see ""unpaid internship"" privilege and similar writings. The #1 predictor of career success is parent's wealth."

You go to specialized education centers and learn best practice, and then train with masters (apprenticeships should be in more than just manufacturing).

They intrinsically assume that if it's free it must be worse.  Netflix is 1080p and costs $9. Bittorrent is free and ""claims"" to be 1080p- nope it's a lie. Couldn't possibly be true. 

Game of Thrones was the #1 most pirated show because HBO had significant barriers up to get to it, (they've since lowered those barriers).

Charter schools get a lot of leeway over who they allow into their schools and comparing them with public schools who dont have choice is a little unfair. I have personally sat in on charter-equivalent admissions processes that involved identifying child ""fit"" into our abilities to help them learn. This is the flip side of what you say, ""we change our teaching to fit the student""-  the constraint to your teaching options is teacher skills and resources- so you must already select students that fit those constraints. 

I do believe (from personal experience with children with learning differences) that the modern public classroom environment is designed for skills like selective passiveness, self-control, patience, and often relies on class biases like having a parent at home to buy supplies, reinforce learning (essentially free tutoring at that point), and handle basic organization (a teacher can give this 7 year old a piece of paper and expect it back the next day knowing it was at least looked at outside of school)."

Treasonous. 

Employers will 1 day create objective- skill based- job explanations for all of their jobs. They will look for employees with those skills shown in a reproducible, testable, objective manner. They will post jobs with specific examples of daily tasks and maybe even a short paragraph written by someone who currently does the job.

In my short time working with psychiatrists in education we found that the best methods were those that focused on what the child had control over (or at least felt they had control over). 

The positive reinforcement didn't come from the results - ""you got a 100, you got a 98, you got a 50 what happened"" - not because those things aren't valuable (they clearly are) but it was outside of what the child feels they have control over.  They do their assignment it goes to the ""grading gods"" and it is returned with a number that is essentially random for children under a certain maturity level (i.e. old enough to where they could independently identify their mistakes given notes and some time). 

Instead we focused on reinforcing processes like effort. Some proxies like total time spent practicing, total practice worksheets willingly added  to their work, time they were able to spend focused on one task - for example, sustained writing,. Not feeling done on the first attempt, asking for chances to submit 2 or even 3 versions of an assignment.

The larger companies, especially tech companies, are doing well connecting to universities  and creating intern-talent pipelines, but I would challenge smaller companies to also tap into their local economy and meet with community colleges and even high schools.

While I would never suggest we re-institute sexism, if we believe we have a meritocracy where the most generally skilled people seek the best jobs, we have to consider that the skill levels of nurses and teachers have regressed toward the mean, as now these women are able to become doctors and principals (and other professions).
